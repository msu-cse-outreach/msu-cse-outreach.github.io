                                        We started Saturday's lesson on February 11th with a <code>Spotlight!</code> 
										We welcomed <b>Lionel Palacio</b> with open arms as he taught us all about the new STEM School in Belize. Thank you for joining us, Lionel!

                                        Saturday, February 11 was dedicated to Lists and Tables. Web developers use lists and tables extensively &mdash; for example, ennumerating the ingredients in a recipe as an (unordered) list and the steps to follow in an (ordered) list, and displaying climate data for a region over a week as a table (rows for the days and columns for the high/low temperature, high/low humidity, rainfall, and so on).

										Saturday February 25 was dedicated to learning some CSS, the language that web developers use to <i>style</i> their websites! CSS makes it easy to produce websites with a consistent look-and-feel. The students' were eager and ready to dive into CSS!

                <p>
                    We started this Saturday with a <code>Kahoot!</code> as a fun way
                    to review concepts that coders learned in the first 3 weeks. 
                    We encountered a few technical issues and an error in one of our questions, which only goes to show that these things happen to all of us!
                    Still, everyone seemed to have a good time, and demonstrated that
                    they have learned a ton! 
                </p>


                <p>
                    This Saturday was dedicated to review.
                    The slides below are a few that we reviewed related to including
                    images in webpages.

                    comfort with material covered in the meeting.
                    We were happy to receive overwhelmingly positive responses!
                    It's always scary to try something new, so we were glad to hear that students felt they got off to a good start.

                        Computer Science is challenging and exciting, learning to code is so important to teach students how to communicate and think logically. Coding helps students understand the world around them better. Coding fosters creativity and allows students to apply their creative thinking skills. Joining the MSU x Pathlight Belize Coding Club is a great way to learn these skills in a challenging, engaging, and positive environment. The challenges you overcome, the views you enjoy, and the friends you make are what it's all about.

                        Finally, we asked coders to fill out our "Temperature Check" &mdash; a very brief end-of-meeting survey to gauge
                        comfort with material covered in the meeting.
                        We were happy to receive overwhelmingly positive responses!
                        It's always scary to try something new, so we were glad to hear that students felt they got off to a good start.
                        That said, we want to be sure <i>everyone</i> has a great time at MSU x PCC this spring &mdash; so

										The Spring 2023 MSU x Pathlight - Belize Coding Club (MSUxPCC) kicked off on Saturday with enthusiastic coders
										and eager mentors &mdash; we hope coders are as excited as we are for the coming weeks!
									</p>
									<p>
										The MSUxPCC mentors are thrilled to introduce the world of coding to your student! Computer science and programming
										are all around us in everything we do, and they are so much fun to learn! During this course, we want all students
										to remember that they are learning something new.
                                        It might be challenging at times. But learning
										to overcome those challenges while having fun with new friends is just as important as learning the material. We
										hope your student keeps this in mind as we continue throughout the program.
									</p>
									<p>
										Before we dive into a full recap of Saturday's meeting, we'd like to share a few announcements.
									</p>

										<p>
											The national organization of <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target="_blank">Girls Who Code</a> is offering two summer opportunities for high school students.
										</p>
                                        
										<p>
											The <b>Summer Immersion Program (SIP)</b> is a live, virtual, 2-week introduction to computer science course for 9th-11th graders. 
                                            Students will learn
											HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while getting an inside look into the tech industry through company sponsors.
										</p>
                                        
										<p>
											The <b>Self-Paced Program</b> is a <b>free</b> remote computer science course for 9th-12th graders who prefer not to adhere to a strict schedule.
											Participants can choose to earn beginner-level badges in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development) or an intermediate-level badge in
											Python (for cybersecurity). Students will also have the chance to build a community through weekly sessions and Girls Who Code activities.
										</p>

									<h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
                                    
									<p>
										Coders were let into their Cohort Zoom rooms starting at 10 am &mdash; as students rolled in, 
										mentor-student bonding had already begun! 
									</p>
                                    
									<p>
										To kick things off, each cohort participated in a Show &amp; Tell Icebreaker. Coders and mentors shared an item that they cared about as a way to get to know a bit about one another. Engagement was high, and all enjoyed learning cool information about their peers!
									</p>

									</div>
                                    
									<p>
										Following the icebreaker, we asked coders to complete a program pre-survey, which will help us  
										evaluate and improve MSUxPCC in future years.
										We've learned a lot from pre- and post-surveys in past years &mdash; so we truly
										appreciate our coders' thoughtful feedback! 
                                        Please ask your student if they submitted the
										pre-survey on Saturday &mdash; that is, did they press the <tt>Submit</tt> button? If not, or if they are not sure that they pressed <tt>Submit</tt>, please ask them to (re)fill it and submit <a href="https://forms.gle/AX6YkstBYDRmru2i7" target="_blank">at this Link</a> <b>before the next class</b>.
									</p>
                                    
									<p>
										Next, coders and mentors collaborated to write a club contract setting goals and expectations for
										future meetings. They then set up their 
                                        <a href="https://codehs.com/" target="_blank">CodeHS</a> accounts for use in the coming weeks.
										We'll be working through the <a href="https://codehs.com/course/web_design_matisse/overview" target="_blank">
											"Web Design (Matisse)"
										</a>
										course!

									<p>
										Finally, we asked coders to fill out our "Temperature Check" &mdash; a very brief end-of-meeting survey to gauge
										comfort with material covered in the meeting.
                                        We were happy to receive overwhelmingly positive responses!
										It's always scary to try something new, so we were glad to hear that students felt they got off to a good start.
										That said, we want to be sure <i>everyone</i> has a great time at MSU x PCC this spring &mdash; so
										if you're having issues with <b>anything</b>, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.
									</p>
									<h4 class="text-center">Mentor Spotlight</h4>
									<p>
										MSU x PCC is led, organized, and run by MSU students with the help of <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/iselava1">Teresa Isela Vandersloot</a> and
										<a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/ldillon">Dr. Laura Dillon</a>.
										To help coders learn more about the <a href="team.html">MSU x PCC team members</a> who make this club possible, we will 
										spotlight a few of them each week.
									</p>
									<p>
										To kick off our mentor spotlight series, we'd like to introduce the Spring 2023 Admins! They have been working hard to get you all registered and keep you informed of plans for going forward.

									<h2 class="text-center">Spring 2023</h2>
									<p>
										We are thrilled to offer MSU x Pathlight Coding Club for a 
                                        second year starting this January!
										Thanks to the generocity of our <a href="supporters.html">sponsors and supporters</a>, we were able to approve 60 students to enroll 
                                        again this year.
										Participants will be grouped into 2 cohorts of about 30 each for remote club meetings by Zoom.
										Each cohort will follow the same curriculum, but proceed at their own pace in cohort-specific (synchronous) Zoom meetings.
									</p>
									<p>
										To attend club meetings by Zoom, a participant must have:
                                    </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Submitted a <a href="https://forms.gle/m2bLwMJ8oBUJ1LdJ8" target="_blank">MSU x Pathlight Coding Club Confirmation form</a>.</li>
											<li>Returned a signed <a href="documents/ss23_belizecc_consent_form.pdf" target="_blank">Parent Consent form (.pdf)</a>.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Returned a signed <a href="documents/MSUMediaReleaseForm.pdf" target="_blank">Media Release form (.pdf)</a></li>
										</ul>
										Please notify <a href="mailto:belizecc@egr.msu.edu">belizecc@egr.msu.edu</a> if you experience difficulty with any of these forms.
									<p>
										An email will be sent to participants notifying them of the Zoom information for their cohort by the end of day Monday, January 9.
										Please white-list <em>belizecc@egr.msu.edu</em> so that your mailer does not label email that we send you as spam.
										Send an email to <a href="mailto:belizecc@egr.msu.edu">belizecc@egr.msu.edu</a> if you have not received a notice with your cohort information by Tuesday morning.
