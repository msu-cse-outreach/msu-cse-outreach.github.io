                                        We started this Saturday with a <code>Kahoot!</code> as a fun way
                                        to review concepts that coders learned in the first 3 weeks. 
                                        We encountered a few technical issues and an error in one of our questions, which only goes to show that these things happen to all of us!
                                        Still, everyone seemed to have a good time, and demonstrated that
                                        they have learned a ton! 
                                    </p>

                                        This Saturday was dedicated to review.
                                        The slides below are a few that we reviewed related to including
                                        images in webpages.

													The <b>Summer Immersion Program (SIP)</b> is a live, virtual, 2-week introductory computer science course for current eligible 9th, 10th, and 11th grade US students and international students ages 14-18. SIP participants learn web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while getting an inside look into the tech industry through incredible company partners. In addition to a completely free program, we offer grants up to $500 and tech support for qualifying students.
												</li>
												<li style="list-style: disc">
													The <b>Self-Paced Program</b> is a 6-week flexible computer science course for current eligible 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade US students (including SIP alumni and graduating seniors) and international students ages 14-18 who prefer not to adhere to a set schedule. Self-Paced Program participants can choose to earn beginner-level badges in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development or an intermediate-level badge in Python for cybersecurity. Students will also have the opportunity to build community through weekly live advisory sessions and Girls Who Code activities.

													I've been around it my last 4 years and have seen how amazing it can be—and how everyone who does it seems to love it.
												</p>
												<p>
													<b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
													My team and I used MATLAB to program a robot to navigate through an obstacle course in one of my first engineering courses.
													<p>
													<b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
													I plan on writing code that can help make the process of building infrastructure be safer and more sustainable.

										We made it through our first 2 weeks! We'd like to thank and congratulate our students for their energy and enthusiasm; our students' parents for their ongoing support and encouragement; our mentors for making each Saturday exciting, engaging, and entertaining; and our advisors for their organization, coordination and commitment to making this a reality. Without you all, we wouldn't be here.
									</p>
									<p>
										Computer Science is challenging and exciting, learning to code is so important to teach students how to communicate and think logically. Coding helps students understand the world around them better. Coding fosters creativity and allows students to apply their creative thinking skills. Joining the MSU x Pathlight Belize Coding Club is a great way to learn these skills in a challenging, engaging, and positive environment. The challenges you overcome, the views you enjoy, and the friends you make are what it's all about.

									<p>
										Before we dive into a full recap of Saturday's meeting, we'd like to share a few announcements.

									<h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
									<p>
										Our first 2 meetings have been an absolute blast, featuring a healthy mix of icebreakers, collaborative code-alongs, and hands-on exercises. Meeting 1 included a Zoom orientation and introduced the basics of HTML, Meeting 2 included a review and introduced new topics to HTML like Links! 
									</p>
                                    
									<p>
										To kick things off, each cohort participated in a Speed Friending Icebreaker. Coders and mentors shared an item that they cared about as a way to get to know a bit about one another. Engagement was high, and all enjoyed learning cool information about their peers!

										Finally, we asked coders to fill out our "Temperature Check" &mdash; a very brief end-of-meeting survey to gauge
										comfort with material covered in the meeting.
                                        We were happy to receive overwhelmingly positive responses!
										It's always scary to try something new, so we were glad to hear that students felt they got off to a good start.
										That said, we want to be sure <i>everyone</i> has a great time at MSU x PCC this spring &mdash; so

										The Spring 2023 MSU x Pathlight - Belize Coding Club (MSUxPCC) kicked off on Saturday with enthusiastic coders
										and eager mentors &mdash; we hope coders are as excited as we are for the coming weeks!
									</p>
									<p>
										The MSUxPCC mentors are thrilled to introduce the world of coding to your student! Computer science and programming
										are all around us in everything we do, and they are so much fun to learn! During this course, we want all students
										to remember that they are learning something new.
                                        It might be challenging at times. But learning
										to overcome those challenges while having fun with new friends is just as important as learning the material. We

									<h2 class="text-center">Spring 2023</h2>
									<p>
										We are thrilled to offer MSU x Pathlight Coding Club for a 
                                        second year starting this January!
										Thanks to the generocity of our <a href="supporters.html">sponsors and supporters</a>, we were able to approve 60 students to enroll 
                                        again this year.
										Participants will be grouped into 2 cohorts of about 30 each for remote club meetings by Zoom.
										Each cohort will follow the same curriculum, but proceed at their own pace in cohort-specific (synchronous) Zoom meetings.
									</p>
									<p>
										To attend club meetings by Zoom, a participant must have:
                                    </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Submitted a <a href="https://forms.gle/m2bLwMJ8oBUJ1LdJ8" target="_blank">MSU x Pathlight Coding Club Confirmation form</a>.</li>
											<li>Returned a signed <a href="documents/ss23_belizecc_consent_form.pdf" target="_blank">Parent Consent form (.pdf)</a>.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>Returned a signed <a href="documents/MSUMediaReleaseForm.pdf" target="_blank">Media Release form (.pdf)</a></li>
										</ul>
										Please notify <a href="mailto:belizecc@egr.msu.edu">belizecc@egr.msu.edu</a> if you experience difficulty with any of these forms.
									<p>
										An email will be sent to participants notifying them of the Zoom information for their cohort by the end of day Monday, January 9.
										Please white-list <em>belizecc@egr.msu.edu</em> so that your mailer does not label email that we send you as spam.
										Send an email to <a href="mailto:belizecc@egr.msu.edu">belizecc@egr.msu.edu</a> if you have not received a notice with your cohort information by Tuesday morning.
