												<h4 class="section-title">Let's Begin!</h4>
											</div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>
										We kicked off the Spring 2023 version of BelizexPathlight on Saturday with enthusiastic students
										and incredible mentors &mdash; we hope your student is just as excited as we are for the coming weeks!
									</p>
									<p>
										We as a club are so excited to introduce the world of coding to your student! Computer science and programming
										is all around us in everything we do, and it is so much fun to learn! During this course, we want all students
										to remember that they are learning something new, it might be challenging at times. But! &mdash; learning
										to overcome those challenges and how to have fun with it is just as important as learning the material. We
										hope your student keeps this in mind as we continue throughout the program.
									</p>
									<p>
										Before we dive into a full recap of Saturday's meeting, we'd like to share a few announcements.
									</p>
									<h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
									<ul>
										<h4>1. Participant Pre-Survey</h4>
										<p>
											Students were encouraged to fill out the
											<a href="https://forms.gle/AX6YkstBYDRmru2i7">2023 BelizexPathlight Participant Pre-Survey</a>
											at Saturday's meeting, but not everyone submitted their responses.
											If your student has not yet completed the pre-survey,
											please have them do so before this Saturday's meeting.
										</p>
										<h4>2. Bonus Hour</h4>
										<p>
											Continuing as a <a href="http://technovation.cadl.org/">Technovation</a> and BelizexPathlight, we'll be hosting
											a BelizexPathlight "bonus hour" every <b>Thursday from 7:00-8:00p BZT</b>
											(beginning this Thursday, 1/19) open to all BZE students 
											participants. BelizexPathlight mentors will be available on Zoom during the bonus hour
											to resolve technical difficulties, dive deeper into the coding concepts we've learned,
											or to talk about computer science in general!
										</p>
										<p>
											Use the Zoom link below to join us for a bonus hour of fun each week.
											The password for our bonus hour will always be the same as the password from the
											previous Saturday's meeting (sent via email only).
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li style="list-style: disc"><b>Zoom Link:</b> <a href="https://msu.zoom.us/j/92304876048">https://msu.zoom.us/j/92304876048</a> (password is same as the one for your Cohort Zoom)</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>3. Girls Who Code Summer Programs</h4>
										<p>
											The national organization of Girls Who Code is offering <b>free</b>, virtual summer opportunities for high school students, to keep track when the application releases, fill out this <a href="https://survey.alchemer.com/s3/6908277/2023-Girls-Who-Code-Summer-Programs-Interest-Form">Form.</a>
										</p>
										<p>
											The <b>Summer Immersion Program (SIP)</b> is a live, virtual, 2-week intro computer science course for 9th-11th graders. You will learn
											HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while getting an inside look into the tech industry through company sponsors.
										</p>
										<p>
											The <b>Self-Paced Program</b> is a flexible computer science course for 9th-12th graders who prefer not to adhere to a strict schedule.
											Participants can choose to earn beginner-level badges in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development) or an intermediate-level badge in
											Python (for cybersecurity). Students will also have the chance to build a community through weekly sessions and Girls Who Code activities.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you are interested, the application interest form is linked above only takes about 15-20 minutes to complete, and doesn't require GPA, transcripts,
											or recommendations!
										</p>
										<h4>4. Looking Ahead</h4>
										<p>
											We'll see you again this <b>Saturday, 1/21 at 10a BZT</b> for our second BelizexPathlight meeting of the spring, where we will review last weeks material
											and begin learning about text + links in webpages!
										</p>
										<h4>5. Questions?</h4>
										<p>
											As always, please reach out with any questions / concerns / ideas / feedback to <a href="mailto:belizecc@egr.msu.edu">belizecc@egr.msu.edu</a>.
										</p>
									</ul>
									<h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
									<p>
										Mentors welcomed participants in their Cohort Zoom rooms, and as students rolled in
										mentor-student bonding had already begun! 
									</p>
									<p>
										To kick things off, each cohort participated in a Show&Tell you Icebreaker. We used it as an opportunity begin getting to
										know the students and the mentors by sharing sentimental items! We got great student engagement and found out some cool information about our cohorts.
									</p>
									<div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-md-12" align="middle">
												<img class="shadow-lg" src="Images/Lessons/Week1/icebreaker.png" width=75%>
											</div>
										</div>
										<br>
										<div class="row">
											<p><i>An example of the Ice Breaker!</i></p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>
										Following the icebreaker, participants completed a program pre-survey which will help us
										evaluate and improve BelizexPathlight in future years.
										We've learned a lot from pre- and post-surveys in past years&mdash;we truly
										appreciate our participants' thoughtful feedback! If your student did not complete the
										pre-survey, please encourage them to do so <a href="https://forms.gle/AX6YkstBYDRmru2i7">at this link</a>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Next, each cohort collaborated to write a club contract setting goals and expectations for
										future meetings, and set up CodeHS accounts for use in the coming weeks.
										We'll be working through the <a href="https://codehs.com/course/web_design_matisse/overview">
											"Web Design (Matisse)"
										</a>
										course offered by CodeHS!
									</p>
									<div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-md-6" align="middle">

											</div>
											<div class="col-md-6" align="middle">
												<img class="shadow-lg" src="Images/Lessons/Week1/greencohortclubrules.png" height=300px>
											</div>
										</div>
										<br>
										<div class="row">
											<p><i>A couple of the cohort club contracts - looking good!</i></p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>
										Finally, we encouraged participants to fill out an end-of-meeting survey to gauge
										comfort with Zoom and CodeHS, and received overwhelmingly positive responses!
										It's always scary to try something new, so we were glad to hear students that the students got off to a good start.
										That said, we want to make sure <i>everyone</i> has a great time at BelizexPathlight this spring&mdash;so
										if you're having issues with anything, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.
									</p>
									<h4 class="text-center">Mentor Spotlight</h4>
									<p>
										BelizexPathlight is led, organized, and run by MSU students with the help of <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/iselava1">Teresa Isela Vandersloot</a>,
										<a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/ldillon">Dr. Laura Dillon</a> and <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/wulfekuh">Dr. Marilyn Wulfekulher</a>,
										and we thought it would be fun to
										introduce a few of our <a href="team.html">team members</a> each week.
									</p>
									<p>
										To kick off our mentor spotlight series, we'd like to introduce the Spring 2023 Admins!

                                        again this year.
										Participants will be grouped into 2 cohorts of about 30 each for remote club meetings by Zoom.
										Each cohort will follow the same curriculum, but proceed at their own pace in cohort-specific (synchronous) Zoom meetings.
									</p>
									<p>
										To attend club meetings by Zoom, a participant must have:
                                    </p>
