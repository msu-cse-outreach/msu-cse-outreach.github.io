									<h2 class="text-center">Week 2</h2>
									<p>
										We made it through our first week! We'd like to thank and congratulate our students for their energy and enthusiasm; our students' parents for their ongoing support and encouragement; our mentors for making each Tuesday and Saturday exciting, engaging, and entertaining; and our advisors for their organization, coordination and commitment to making this a reality. Without you all, we wouldn't be here.
									</p>
									<p>
										Computer Science is challenging and exciting, learning to code is so important to teach students how to communicate and think logically. Coding helps students understand the world around them better. Coding fosters creativity and allows students to apply their creative thinking skills. Joining the MSU x Pathlight Belize Coding Club is a great way to learn these skills in a challenging, engaging, and positive environment. The challenges you overcome, the views you enjoy, and the friends you make are what it's all about. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Before we dive into a full recap of our first five meetings, we've got a few announcements.
									</p>


									<!-- announcements -->
									<h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
									<ul>
										<h4>1. Bonus Hour</h4>
										<p>
											Join us at this week's Bonus Hour on
											<b>Thursday, 27 January from 6-7pm Belize Time (BZT),</b> open to all MSU x Pathlight Belize Coding Club students.
											Two student mentors will be available on zoom during the bonus hour&mdash;this is a great opportunity for 1:1 discussion and support!
											<ul>

										</p>

										<h4>2. Looking Back</h4>
										<p>
											Can you believe we've already completed our first five meetings? Time flies when you're having fun! So far, we've covered the basics of Python and Tracy the Turtle,
											along with an introduction to loops. Check out our <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page for the slides from each meeting.
										</p>
										<h4>3. Looking Ahead</h4>
										<p>
											Remember that <b>we meet every Saturday from 10-11:30a BZT and Tuesday from 4-5:30p BZT, through 26 February!</b> This week, we'll be introducing functions, which will help us simplify our code.

										</p>
										<h4>4. GWC Summer Programs</h4>
										<p>
											What are you up to this summer? <a href="https://girlswhocodesm.smapply.io/">Consider applying to one of two Girls Who Code (GWC) Summer Programs!</a>
											<ul>
												<li style="list-style: disc">
													The <b>Summer Immersion Program (SIP)</b> is a live, virtual, 2-week introductory computer science course for current eligible 9th, 10th, and 11th grade US students and international students ages 14-18. SIP participants learn web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while getting an inside look into the tech industry through incredible company partners. In addition to a completely free program, we offer grants up to $500 and tech support for qualifying students.
												</li>
												<li style="list-style: disc">
													The <b>Self-Paced Program</b> is a 6-week flexible computer science course for current eligible 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade US students (including SIP alumni and graduating seniors) and international students ages 14-18 who prefer not to adhere to a set schedule. Self-Paced Program participants can choose to earn beginner-level badges in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for web development or an intermediate-level badge in Python for cybersecurity. Students will also have the opportunity to build community through weekly live advisory sessions and Girls Who Code activities.
												</li>
											</ul>
											<br>
											Girls Who Code is a US-based nonprofit which aims to close the gender gap in technology, and sponsors our sister club, <a href="https://www.spartangwc.org/">Spartan Girls Who Code</a>.

									<h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
									<p>
										Our first five meetings have been an absolute blast, featuring a healthy mix of icebreakers, spotlights on individuals in tech, collaborative code-alongs, and hands-on exercises. Meeting 1 included a Zoom orientation and program overview; Meetings 2 and 3 introduced Python and basic commands to control Tracy the Turtle; and Meetings 4 and 5 introduced for loops to simplify our code.

									<p>
										We are excited to launch the first SS22 MSU x Pathlight Coding Club on Saturday, 15 January!
										Thanks to the generocity of our <a href="supporters.html">sponsors and supporters</a>, we were able to approve 60 students to enroll this semester.
										Participants will be grouped into 3 cohorts of about 20 each for remote club meetings by Zoom.
										Each cohort will follow the same curriculum, but proceed at their own pace in cohort-specific (synchronous) Zoom meetings.
									</p>
									<p>
										To attend club meetings by Zoom, a participant must have:
										<ul>
											<li>Submitted a <a href="https://forms.gle/HWgAznFRD5s1cPA19" target="_blank">MSU x Pathlight Coding Club Confirmation form</a>.</li>
											<li>Returned a signed <a href="documents/S22 MSU x Pathlight Consent Form.pdf" target="_blank">Parent Consent form (.pdf)</a>.
										</ul>
										Please notify <a href="mailto:belizecc@egr.msu.edu">belizecc@egr.msu.edu</a> if you experience difficulty with either form.
									</p>
									<p>
										An email will be sent to participants notifying them of the Zoom information for their cohort by the end of day Tuesday, January 11.
										Please white-list <em>belizecc@egr.msu.edu</em> so that your mailer does not label mail that we send you as spam.
										Send an email to <a href="mailto:belizecc@egr.msu.edu">belizecc@egr.msu.edu</a> if you have not received a notice with your cohort information by Wednesday morning.
