												<h2 class="section-title">Week 2</h2>
												<h4 class="section-title">Let's get started!</h4>
											</div>
										</div>
									</div>
									<p>
										We made it through our first week! We'd like to thank and congratulate our students for their energy and enthusiasm; our students' parents for their ongoing support and encouragement; our mentors for making each Tuesday and Saturday exciting, engaging, and entertaining; and our advisors for their organization, coordination and commitment to making this a reality. Without you all, we wouldn't be here.

									</p>
									<p>
										Computer Science is challenging and exciting, learning to code is so important to teach students how to communicate and think logically. Coding helps students understand the world around them better. Coding fosters creativity and allows students to apply their creative thinking skills. Joining the MSU x Belize Pathlight Program is a great way to learn these skills in a challenging, engaging, and positive environment. The challenges you overcome, the views you enjoy, and the friends you make are all apart about enjoying the journey and what it's all about. 

									</p>
									<p>
										Before we dive into a full recap of last weeks meetings, we've got a few announcements.
									</p>
									<h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
									<ul>
										<h4>1. Bonus Hour</h4>
										<p>
											Join us at this week's Bonus Hour on
											<b>Thursday, 1/27 from 6-7pm CST</b>, open to all MSU x Belize Pathlight Students.
											Two MSU x Belize mentors will be available on zoom during the bonus hour&mdash;this is a great opportunity for 1:1 discussion and support on final projects!
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li style="list-style: disc"><b>Zoom Link:</b> <a href="https://msu.zoom.us/j/98274965748">https://msu.zoom.us/j/96070110748</a> (password: MSU)</li>
										</ul>
										<h4>2. Future Projects</h4>
										<p>
											We'd like to give students the chance to show off their impressive final projects from SGWC, and invite you to join us for a (virtual) final project fair <b>this Saturday, 3/27 between 10a-12p</b>! The virtual fair will take place during our usual meeting time, and <b>we encourage parents and siblings to join us.</b> Students will be participating in an icebreaker and spotlight between 10-10:45, but will be available to show you around between 10:45-11:30ish.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you're new to Gather, check out <a href="https://support.gather.town/help/movement-and-basics">this tutorial</a> for an introduction of what to expect!
										</p>
										<h4>3. Looking Ahead</h4>
										<p>
											Reminder! We meet Tuesday's 4-5:30 pm (CST) and Saturday's 10-11:30 pm (CST)! 
										</p>
										<h4>4. Questions?</h4>
										<p>
											As always, please reach out with any questions / concerns / ideas / feedback to <a href="mailto:belizecc@egr.msu.edu">belizecc@egr.msu.edu</a>.
										</p>
									</ul>
									<h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
									<p>
										In preparation for next Saturday's final project fair, we kicked off last Saturday's meeting with a "Project Show and Tell" icebreaker. Students shared rough drafts of their final projects, exchanged ideas, traded compliments, drew inspiration from one another, and had a blast showing off their hard work!
									</p>
									<p>
										We'd like to keep our students' creations a surprise for the final project fair, so we'll hold off on including any previews in this week's newsletter. Of course, you're always welcome to ask your own student to share what they've been working on! What did they have to say in response to this week's discussion questions?
										<ul>
											<li style="list-style: disc">Did you decide to do a spin off or a new project?</li>
											<li style="list-style: disc">What do you want to try to add on today?</li>
											<li style="list-style: disc">What part was the easiest so far?</li>
											<li style="list-style: disc">Is there a part that's been tricky to figure out?</li>
											<li style="list-style: disc">What is your favorite part of your project so far?</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
										Following show-and-tell, we dove into an interactive spotlight highlighting the broad intersection between art, games and computer science. Computer science is often perceived as meticulous and monotonous&mdash;yet in reality, this stereotype is far from the truth. In fact, code empowers creativity, a colorful imagination, and an anything-is-possible spirit!
									</p>
									<p>
										Students saw this first hand on Saturday by exploring Google's <a href="https://www.autodraw.com/">AutoDraw</a> and <a href="https://g.co/arts/xaPj9bAG1Ehu7mDY8">Puzzle Party</a>, an artistic <a href="https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/">Fluid Simulation</a> engine, and the open-ended, create-your-own-world <a href="https://sandspiel.club/">Sandspiel</a> environment. Ask them to show you their favorite site&mdash;and while you're at it, ask why they think creativity is important in computer science!

										After our spotlight, students continued working on their final projects, adding finishing touches and getting their code in tip-top shape for next Saturday's final project fair. We can't wait to see you there&mdash;we promise you'll be impressed! Our students have done amazing work over the last 9 weeks.
									</p>
									<p>
										Speaking of the final project fair: our Gather space is decked out and looking good! Hannah, one of our lead mentors, did an amazing job decorating and setting up "interactive" posters which display students' final projects. During the final project fair, students, parents, and siblings will be able to explore this space, walking between posters and viewing a variety of final projects.

								<h2>Spring 2022</h2>
								<p>
									We are excited to launch the first SS22 MSU x Pathlight Coding Club on Saturday, January 15!
									Thanks to the generocity of our sponsors and supporters, we were able to approve 60 students to enroll this semester.
									Participants will be grouped into 3 cohorts of about 20 each for remote club meetings by Zoom.
									Each cohort will follow the same curriculum, but proceed at their own pace in cohort-specific (synchronous) Zoom meetings.
								</p>
								<p>
									To attend club meetings by Zoom, a participant must have:
									<ul>
										<li>Submitted a <a href="https://forms.gle/HWgAznFRD5s1cPA19" target="_blank">MSU x Pathlight Coding Club Confirmation form</a>.</li>
										<li>Returned a signed <a href="documents/S22 MSU x Pathlight Consent Form.pdf" target="_blank">Parent Consent form (.pdf)</a>.
									</ul>
									Please notify <a href="mailto:belizecc@egr.msu.edu">belizecc@egr.msu.edu</a> if you experience difficulty with either form.
								</p>
								<p>
									An email will be sent to participants notifying them of the Zoom information for their cohort by the end of day Tuesday, January 11.
									Please white-list <em>belizecc@egr.msu.edu</em> so that your mailer does not label mail that we send you as spam.
									Send an email to <a href="mailto:belizecc@egr.msu.edu">belizecc@egr.msu.edu</a> if you have not received a notice with your cohort information by Wednesday morning.
