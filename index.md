# MSU Spartan Coding Clubs (SPARCC)

<div style="text-align:center"><em>Technology's future begins in today's classrooms!</em></div>

The [Office for Women in Engineering, Recruitment, Civic Engagement and K-12 Outreach](https://www.egr.msu.edu/wie/) and the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu/) are committed to empowering the next generation of leaders in technology through K-12 outreach.

## Mission

We aim to broaden participation in computer science among K-12 students in Michigan and beyond. By engaging K-12 students in face-to-face and virtual programs led by near-peer university student mentors, we aim to build excitement across the rapidly growing fields of information technology, data science and software engineering.

In particular, we aim to remove the many barriers to entry in computer science which disproportionately affect female- and LGBTQIA+-identifying, Black, Latinx, Native American and socioeconomically underprivileged individuals.

In achieving its goals, the Office for Women in Engineering, Recruitment and K-12 Outreach does not unlawfully
discriminate. All events and programs are open to students of all genders.
