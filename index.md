# MSU CSE Outreach

The Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University is committed to empowering the next generation of leaders in technology through K-12 outreach. 

Technology's future begins in today's classrooms.

In achieving its goals, the Office for Women in Engineering, Recruitment and K-12 Outreach does not unlawfully
discriminate. All events and programs are open to students of all genders.

## NEW! Register Interest in Fall 2021 Technovation

We are now accepting registrations of interest in the Fall 2021 session of Technovation, offered virtually from
Lansing, Detroit and All Michigan. [Submit this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYkEGDvLGIvvX1IrDSDeyeFis2kaqU4k3s0Yk1NCTFTchmYA/viewform?usp=sf_link) to register your interest today!

## Mission

We aim to broaden participation in computer science among K-12 students in Michigan and beyond. By engaging K-12 students in face-to-face and virtual programs led by near-peer university student mentors, we aim to build excitement across the rapidly growing fields of information technology, data science and software engineering. 

In particular, we aim to remove the many barriers to entry in computer science which disproportionately affect female- and LGBTQIA+-identifying, Black, Latinx, Native American and socioeconomically underprivileged individuals.
