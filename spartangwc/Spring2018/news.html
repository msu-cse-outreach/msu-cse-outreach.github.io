                                    We enjoyed getting to know your daughters this spring. We hope the short foray into computing has piqued their interest and that they will continue exploring the fascinating world of computing this summer and beyond. See our <a href="resources.html" target="_blank">Resources page</a> for ideas. Thank you for encouraging your daughters that they can do whatever they put their minds to. Have a great summer!

                                    Our last meeting of SGWC will be a week from Saturday (April 21). Coders will demo their impact projects. Parents and siblings are invited to stay for the demos and some light refreshments. We'll send more information about logistics in the coming week.
                                </p>

                                    Those of you who checked out a Micro Bit: Please remember to bring them to class tomorrow.  We will love if you can briefly say what you did with them---or better yet, give a quick demo.

Teams of up to 5 competitors face a series of increasingly challenging problems, in which they must break, hack, decrypt, reverse engineer or do whatever it takes to find hidden flags (answer strings). Challenges will be distributed across the spectrum, for beginners and for experts. Prizes totaling $20,000 in value will be awarded to the top-ranking teams.

                                    We love that several of you are learning about the micro:bit! When it comes to what you can do with this little device, the sky is the limit.  You can program it to play music while displaying messages and simple images, detect and respond to motion and orientation and much more.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In addition to the tutorial on Grok Learning (<a href="https://groklearning.com/hoc/activity/virtual-pet/" target="_blank">https://groklearning.com/hoc/activity/virtual-pet/</a>), there are many tutorials for fun projects using them on <a href="http://microbit.org/" target="_blank">http://microbit.org/</a>.  You can chose to program the micro:bit using Python, Scratch, or Java Script.  Using Python will reinforce ideas you have been learning in SGWC.
                                </p>

                                    If you create an account on Grok Learning using your SGWC address, we will receive an automated verification email checking that you are an actual person (not a &quot;bot&quot;).  As soon as we see the mail, we will verify your identity and let you know.  Creating an account on Grok Learning will enable you to save your work and also give you access to lots of other tutorials and programming competitions.

                                    Don't forget to bring the micro:bit with you this Saturday loaded and ready to demo to your class.  If you have trouble loading your program onto the micro:bit, we can show you how on Saturday provided that you have saved your program in the cloud (e.g., on Grok Learning or in Codesters).

They are also very economical to purchase at <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/932" target="_blank">https://www.adafruit.com/category/932</a> (you will want the 'Go Bundle,' which is currently sold out; add yourself to the waiting list to be notified when they are in-stock, which should be soon).

                                    It will be great if you are able to practice using the concepts learned in the first half of SGWC during this break.  Regular practice and review are the key to becoming proficient in coding.

                                    Last Saturday, coders worked with variables and wire framing.  To get the most from our meeting this Saturday, coders may wish to review  the first three lessons of <a href="https://www.codesters.com/" target="_blank">codesters.com</a>.  The key to learning to code is practice.

                                    In the first 4 meetings, coders also decided that the theme for their impact project will be Art.  After this Saturday, they will have enough coding under their belts to begin implementation.  In the meantime, they continue to research their theme and discuss their designs.
