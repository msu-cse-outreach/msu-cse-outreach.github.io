        Their are quite a few workouts that we recommend:<br>
        •Kids Workouts <!--<img src="http://beyondfitmom.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pyramid-workout-for-kids.png" style="width:500px;height:600px;"> -->
        COPYRIGHTED IMAGE DELETED.<br>
        •Instructions for Kids Workouts- Do this 3 times a day before or after meal times. If kids are younger than 6 they might not be able to do this. Instead have them do 30 jumping jacks a day. For 7-9 year olds, they might need to do 3/4 of all these excersizes because their body might not be able to do all the work. For 10-12 year olds, have them just follow the picture. For teens, they can do this workout 4 times instead of 3 times a day.<br>
        •For beginners<img src="https://www.fitwirr.com/media/2015/01/14/body-weight-circuit-workout-for-beginners.jpg" style="width:300px;height:500px;"> .<br>
        •Instructions for Beginners Workouts- Do each of the excersizes 2 times a day. If you are a intermediate, do the excersizes 3 or 4 times a day.<br>
