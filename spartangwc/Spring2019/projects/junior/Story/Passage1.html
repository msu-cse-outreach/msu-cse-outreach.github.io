    <p>
      She takes the passage with the bright light. She sees a box wedged between two rocks. She opens the box and discovers a notebook! The notebook is a mysterious journal. Her dad's name is on it! This was his book! There's directions to the mountains in the book. She hesitates. She knows the mountains are very dangerous at night - full of hundreds of giant, vicious WOLVES! Should she follow the directions, or go home to safety?
