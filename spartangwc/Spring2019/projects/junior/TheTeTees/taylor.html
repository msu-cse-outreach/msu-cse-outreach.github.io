    <h1>Set and Props</h1>
    
    Sets and Props have been used for years in plays and movies. Take your favorite movie and think about all the places the characters went and all the stuff they used. That was all created by set and prop.  
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>What is the Diffrence Between Sets and Props</h2>
    <h4>Sets</h4>
  
    <p>Sets are the background of the play/movie you will be in. Sets are things in the background to show where and when the charaters are. Sets aren't built into the stage and are moved on and off the stage after each scene. Some sets are even created by a green screen. Green screens make it so you can edit in backgrounds and special effects.</p>
    
    <p>Have you ever seen Harry Potter? How about Star Wars? Everywhere those characters went, all those places. They were all something called 'sets'. </p>
    
  <h4>Props</h4>  
    <p> Props are the things characters hold in their hands. Props are portable things that actors use to show what they are doing. (such as balls, pencils, stuffed animals, ect.)</p> 
    
    <p>In Harry Potter a prop would be a wand and in Sar Wars a light saber. These are both portable things that the characters use to show the action in the movie. Imagine how funny they would look with out these props.</p>
    
    
    
    <h2>What You Might Use Set and Prop For</h2>
    
    <p>There are differant ways to use sets and props. I'm just going to list a few then you can click the photo to move to the next station.</p>
    
    <h6>Set Useage</h6>
    <p>If you are in an accual theater than you may use cardboard or chairs as sets. I once used desks and chairs to create an office theam. A little thing can go a long way when creating a set.</p>
    
    <p>If you're in a movie you are probibly going to use a green screen or an accual place. If you're in a naborhood, then they put you in a random naborhood near where you shoot. A lot of times, you will probibly be standing in a room with green screens.</p>
    
    
    <h6>Prop Usage</h6>
    <p>If in a theater than you'll use a homemade trinkit or comon object. There will very rarely be a profesional-made prop. If you're in a nice theater than you will most likely have nicer-made props.</p>
    
    <p>When in a move profesionals will have made the props. They will look a lot nicer than if in a theater. More expinse things will be put in too. There will be acual laptops and phones in this. It's just too make the movie seem more realistic. </p>
