    <h1>The Sims 4</h1>

    <p>The Sims 4 is a computer and console game developed by Maxis and published by EA in September 2014. It is a life simulation game and the main thing you do is control your 'sims' through their daily lives. They can have many jobs and can even start a family.
    </p>
    <p>My personal favorite parts of the game are the Create-a-Sim and build mode parts. It is really fun to create your own people and build them cool homes.
    </p>
    <p>Build mode is the part  of the game where you build homes and other buildings for your Sims. In every home you need some basic things so your sims' 'needs' can be fulfilled. They have many cool furniture items you can use for your amazing houses. You can also get premade rooms from the build mode menu or even full homes from the Gallery.</p>

    <p>The Gallery is a place where you and other players can upload their creations. Maxis, the game creators also have some basic houses in the gallery. Another thing i enjoy about that is remodeling those base homes. In the gallery, they also have premade sims. These are sometimes fun to use because you can make them friends of your sims or they can be your sims.</p>
    <p>Create a sim is the place you make your sims. You design everything about your sims from their hair to their body type. Create-a-Sim is also where you give them cool outfits. Another part is designing who your sims are. You get to decide what their name is, what they want to do for a career, and what their traits are.</p>
    <p>Another thing available is expansion packs, stuff packs, and game packs. They add more items to your game. In the case of the expansion packs, you also get a new 'town' to build in and explore. They just released a new one called 'StrangerVille" where you have to explore a town's scientific mystery and why all the people there are acting <i>strange.</i> Packs do cost money, they are $40-$15 dollars. (I think. I can't access the website for some reason.)
    </p>
    <p> I have the game on console, so I cannot access this but there is also a feature called CC or Custom Content. Custom Content makes your sims more realistic and gives you more options for skin, hair, clothes, and any other Create-a-Sim item. You can also get CC for build mode, but it is less common for people to do so. Most or all CC is free, unlike packs.
