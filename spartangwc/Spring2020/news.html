                        <p>
                            Saturday marked the end of the 2020 session of SGWC, but in every end there is also a new beginning:  the journey through computer
                            science has only just begun for our students and mentors alike. While we'll certainly miss spending Saturday mornings smiling, laughing,
                            and learning together, we look forward to seeing the continued growth and progress of all who took part in SGWC 2020 for years to come. Programming is a lifelong
                            skill, and computational thinking will never fall obsolete &minus; the end of SGWC 2020 is only symbolic. Our Spartan spirit and bond live on!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Of course, we were sure to go out with a bang &minus; symbolic or not, the end always calls for a grand finale.
                            Before a full recap of our final session, a few notes:

                            The 2020 SGWC (Virtual) Grand Finale kicked off with a reflective icebreaker, in which students discussed the following five questions:
                        </p>

                        <div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">
                            <div class="row">
                                <div class="col-md-12" align="middle">
                                    <img src="assets/img/ss20photos/week13/week13icebreaker.jpg" width="80%" style="box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);">
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Instead of generalizing our students' responses here,
                            we encourage you to ask your daughter the same five questions yourself and hear what she has to say! The most powerful aspect of SGWC
                            is not that students leave with a newfound knowledge of and interest in computer science, but that they grow
                            as problem solvers, communicators, and collaborators, building self-confidence and self-trust along the way. What did your daughter
                            find her greatest non-code takeaway to be?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            With the icebreaker behind us, it was game time: splitting up into breakout rooms, students shared their very own JavaScript games with
                            one another and had the chance to play their classmates' creations. In true SGWC spirit, students left one another compliments
                            on each game, applauding each others' creativity, artistic vision, narrative prowess, and clever coding skills. Inspired by their peers'
                            work, some students even left with new ideas to add to their game as a post-graduation challenge! 
                        </p>

                            For the remainder of the session, students faced off in a game of Kahoot to review the HTML, CSS and JS concepts they've learned over the
                            course of the spring. As usual, there was no shortage of laughter &minus; it's impossible not to smile when racing the clock in a high-energy
                            game of trivia against the backdrop of silly music. If students want to relive the experience,

                            To say we ended on a high note would be an understatement &minus; in light of this semester's unique challenges, we ended (quite literally)
                            off the charts. Having adapted to unprecedented challenges in a journey through unmapped territory, our students, mentors, parents, and faculty
                            alike deserve a round of applause for playing their part in an incredibly successful 2020 installment of SGWC. Just as each and every link in
                            a chain gives it its strength, each and every individual who made SGWC possible this spring is to credit for the impact it has left. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It's only a matter of time before we return to normalcy &minus; ten years from now, these times will be but a blip
                            in our memories of 2020. Remember the bright spot of Saturdays mornings with SGWC,
                            and keep an eye on the future. Encourage your student to unleash the problem-solving, can-do attitude of SGWC upon any challenge that comes her
                            way, and she'll be amazed how far it takes her.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Even if she attends university elsewhere, a graduate of SGWC will always be a Spartan &minus; and Spartans Will.

                            Those who complain that there's no room for creativity in code have never programmed &minus; as our students learned firsthand this week,
                            programming is as much of an art as it is a science. Armed with full creative control, students took the JavaScript game we've developed together
                            over the past two weeks and made it their own. From a humble implementation of Pac-Man arose an intricate remix of Pokémon, an interactive simulation
                            of ballet, a maze through musical notes, and a tribute to Super Mario, among other variations
                            &minus; our girls wasted no time realizing their visions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Just as Walt Disney said "If you can dream it, you can do it," our girls would tell you: "If you can dream it you can code it!"

                            Up to this point, the majority of our sessions began with a code-along, in which students would learn a new programming concept,
                            followed by a brief opportunity for students to add their personal touch, changing images, colors, fonts, placement, and sizing,
                            among other website attributes. Saturday's session turned that model inside out, giving students nearly the entire time
                            to apply what they've learned this spring and make their game their own. Builing upon the simple
                            grid-based, button-controlled JavaScript program shown and linked below, students' creations far surpassed our already-high expectations.

                            and provided it for reference.
                            Given that it's live on the web, we encourage students who are looking for a quarantine challenge to continue working through the tutorials
                            they did not finish at this week's session! One of the best cures for boredom is an engaging programming project &minus; a few hours
                            here and there spent learning JavaScript will fly by in no time.

                            For the sake of suspense (and to allow students to continue working through the aforementioned tutorials over the course of this week),
                            we'll wait to showcase student projects until next week's update. To get a sense of what they're working towards, though, check out
                            the example projects our mentors put together in preparation of this week! Challenge your student to take our mentors' ideas to the

                            Programming often earns a reputation for being dry, logical, and mechanistic, leaving little room for "fun and games" &minus;
                            yet, as our students can attest, that's simply not the case. Beyond JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the smiles, laughter
                            and jokes throughout this week's session made evident that our girls had learned a far more important lesson than the syntax
                            and semantics of code: they learned that coding can be a <b>blast!</b>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Repurposing the website they created last week, students created two buttons: "Left" and "Right," then worked step-by-step
                            to make such buttons move an image of their game's protagonist across the screen. So, how does it work? Ask your daughter to
                            explain it to you!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A click of the button calls a <i>function</i> with a <i>parameter</i> indicating whether the character should "move left"
                            or "move right," and depending on the value of this parameter, <i>conditional</i> (if-then) statements are executed to change the
                            placement of the character's image on the screen relative to its previous position on the screen. Pretty neat, eh? Play around
                            with the example website below, and ask your daughter to show you her own code!

                            While students focused on developing the JavaScript "muscles" behind their game this week, they'll have a chance to customize
                            the HTML and CSS defining the aesthetics of their game next week to make it their own. Their character need not be Pac-Man; 
                            their background need not be white; their surroundings need not be empty &minus; any image or geometrical shape will work!
                            They'll have the chance to add "villains," "treasure," and "power-ups" in addition to background images, vertical motion buttons, and more.
                            Programming is a creative activity, and our goal is for our students to see it as such!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            On that note, it's worth mentioning that next week (4/11) will be our last <i>programming</i>-focused SGWC session; the following
                            final session (4/18) will give students a chance to share their projects with one another and celebrate their achievements with
                            virtual student-mentor team games. Time flies when you're having fun!
                        </p>

                            We again want to thank everyone for adapting so well to the new normal &minus; in today's world, the only
                            constant is change. Four weeks ago, the future of SGWC in 2020 was in limbo &minus; but thanks to the passion of our students,
                            encouragement from parents, flexibility of our mentors, and guidance of our advisors, we've made lemonade out of
                            an unexpected shipment of lemons. As Admiral Grace Hopper, famed female computer scientist and pioneer of the modern compiler
                            said, "the most dangerous phrase in the language is: 'we have always done it this way.'"

                            Our third virtual session of the spring brought even more smiles, laughter, and "woah, that's awesome!"-s than the first two &minus; students
                            had a blast learning the basics of JavaScript and adding the dynamic, responsive tools it supports to their ever-growing
                            skillset. As HTML defines the structure of a website and CSS defines the style of a website, JavaScript defines the actions and behavior
                            of a website through the use of <i>functions</i> and <i>parameters.</i>
                        </p>

                            Back to the question at hand: what does coffee have to do with coding? Sure, plenty of programmers enjoy a daily cup of java &minus; but
                            far more enjoy a daily dose of JavaScript. Designed for the web, JavaScript is used on nearly every website you visit
                            in a given day and 
                            <a href="https://news.codecademy.com/javascript-history-popularity/">ranks as one of the most popular programming languages year after year.</a>
                            While HTML and CSS form the skeleton of a website, providing support and specifying structure, JavaScript is the muscular and nervous
                            system, reacting to user input, keyboard presses, mouse clicks, and other events. Without JavaScript, the web is nothing more than
                            a nicely formatted digital document; with JavaScript, it forms the foundation for countless applications, tools, games, and services we
                            rely on every day.

                            Following a crash-course introduction to the fundamentals of JavaScript, students immediately got their feet wet, integrating JavaScript in
                            their websites to display a pop-up message upon the click of a button. In this sense, students made their websites <i>reactive</i>,
                            going beyond the 2D canvas of an HTML page and engaging in a third dimension with the user. Applying their newfound knowledge of
                            JavaScript <i>functions</i>, which carry out a particular task (i.e., display a message), and <i>parameters</i>, which specify how a
                            given task should be carried out, students experimented with different ways to change the text of their pop-up message. Check out the example
                            website below for a sense of the power JavaScript brings to the web!

                            Next week, students will continue their journey through JavaScript to implement a game and integrate it with their
                            Impact Project websites &minus; there's no way we'd be able to accomplish that with only HTML and CSS.
                            As in all creative activities, using the right tool for the job not only makes the job much easier, but makes it possible in the first place
                            &minus; programming is no exception!

                        <p>
                            Technical matters aside, we again thank our parents and students for such optimism and positivity during these times.
                            Back by popular demand, we opened this week's session with a virtual icebreaker in which students could "virtually show-and-tell"
                            their past week in the form of a GIF, meme, or image. Social distancing does not imply that social isolation must follow &minus;
                            we're all in this together! 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Through jokes and anecdotes, our students continue to remind us why we established Spartan Girls Who
                            Code in the first place: not only to increase female representation in computer science, but to make friendships, learn from one another,
                            laugh with one another, and grow together.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           As Spartans, Michiganders, and Americans, we wish you good health, safety, and continuity through the week ahead. We'll see you

                            This week, students harnessed their HTML and CSS powers to add a trivia quiz to their impact project websites.
                            Asking questions about their impact project topic
                            and using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp">ordered lists</a> to display
                            answers, students thereafter had to "think outside of the page" in order to make their quiz interactive. By adding
                            two additional new webpages to their site &minus; one displaying "Correct!" and the other displaying "Wrong" &minus; then
                            cleverly linking their answers to these pages, our girls created fully-functioning quizzes. Clicking on the
                            right answer redirects the user to the page displaying "Correct!" while clicking on a wrong answer takes the user to the page
                            which displays "Wrong." Check out the link below for an example of this week's project!

                        <p>
                            In addition, students learned how to display GIFs and images on their website, and reviewed key CSS styling
                            techniques, then applied such knowledge to spruce up the fonts, colors, and feel of their website. Our code-alongs
                            have been a team-effort, but each student's styling is her own unique vision!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As productive as this week's session was, perhaps the true highlight came before we even kicked off the lesson &minus;
                            together, our mentors and students joined in on a virtual icebreaker to get comfortable using Zoom and speaking up over
                            the airwaves. In response to the prompt "Describe your last week with a GIF, image, or meme," individuals shared their
                            experience under quarantine by pasting GIFs, images, and memes into a shared Google Document, then took turns to tell
                            a story about their "new normal." A little humor went a long way, and set spirits high for the rest of our session!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We're already looking forward to next week's (3/28) session, and hope you are too &minus; in times like these, we're strongest

                            wasn't easy, but was well-worth it! This week's inaugural Zoom SGWC session was a blast, attended by over 20 students.
                            We hope to see that number rise even higher next week!

                            Students continued to dive deeper in their impact projects this week, adding a new "Videos" page to their website and embedding YouTube
                            videos within. Further, students configured a navigation bar for their website to easily and swiftly transition between
                            pages. By clicking on the home icon, students' websites would navigate to the homepage; by clicking on the video icon, students' websites
                            would navigate to the "Videos" page containing embedded YouTube videos. Finally, students broadened their knowledge of CSS and added
                            additional style rules to their website, changing font sizes, text and background colors, alignment, and more to make their site their own!

                            for mentors, this week's session doubled as the same! Over the next few sessions, we'll
                            continue to experiment on what works and what doesn't in the virtual setting, and change our approach accordingly.

                        <p>
                            We applaud our girls for adapting so quickly and for bringing unconditional positivity to this week's session! In spite of the circumstances,
                            their excitement and readiness to learn brought smiles to our faces.

                            Preliminary feedback at the end of our virtual session was overwhelmingly positive, but we know there's room for improvement. Regardless of
                            whether or not your student tuned into the 3/14 virtual session, we'd like to gather your thoughts on virtual sessions moving forward with a

                            April 20, all SGWC sessions have been cancelled through April 20. Social distancing has proven to be the most effective
                            way to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and we must all do our part. Although we will certainly miss interacting with 
                            SGWC students for the coming weeks, the health and wellness of our participants, parents, mentors, and faculty is of
                            paramount importance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In spite of the circumstances, we want to continue to offer the educational opportunity of SGWC to the best of our ability. Thus, we have
                            made plans to implement (optional) virtual sessions beginning Saturday, March 14 for students who would like to stay involved and
                            continue to learn the fundamentals of web design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We will be offering such virtual sessions through Zoom, a free virtual meeting platform. Students can join the Zoom session by clicking
                            the link below anytime after 9:30am on Saturday mornings. Upon clicking the link, you will be automatically prompted to install the free Zoom software
                            client if you do not already have it installed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although we're still ironing out the details of how virtual sessions will work, our tentative plan is as follows:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    1. Students are welcome to join the meeting anytime &minus; instruction will begin slightly after 10am. We encourage
                                    students to join early if possible to work out any technical difficulties.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    2. A lead instructor will work through a code-along on CodeHS, engaging with students through questions and conversation,
                                    and will share their screen on Zoom for students to see.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    3. Students may follow along and write their own code on CodeHS as the instructor works.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    4. A co-instructor will be available to work with students 1:1 and answer individual, in-depth questions by utilizing
                                    Zoom breakout rooms.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    5. Other questions can be asked and answered by anyone in the session through the Zoom group chat.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    6. Students can raise their hand by clicking a "raise hand" button in the session.
                                </li>
                                <br>
                                <li>
                                    7. Following the introduction of a new web design topic (e.g., including video on a website, animating features on a website,
                                    making "quiz" questions on a website, embedding content in websites, etc.), students will put the new topic into
                                    use by adding content to their impact project website.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <i>Planning</i> is one thing &minus; <i>doing</i> is another. This week, our students moved from ideas to implementation and began
                            coding their impact projects, in which they'll connect computer science to a passion of their choice. As we've emphasized over
                            the course of the spring through spotlight videos and talks, computing can take you anywhere! Every major corporation,
                            organization, and non-profit needs a website and IT infrastructure, perhaps in addition to an e-commerce storefront, AI chatbot,
                            mobile app, or logistics management program. Google is certainly hiring computer science graduates like crazy, but so are clothing
                            companies, medical conglomerates, food corporations, academic institutions, and art galleries!

                                    &bullet; SGWC will resume meeting on Saturday, 3/14 following the two week hiatus due to MSU's spring break.

                                    &bullet; SGWC is closely monitoring the developing COVID-19 situation and will adhere to 
                                    <a href="http://msu.edu/coronavirus">MSU's policies</a>
                                    to prevent and respond to a potential outbreak. If MSU cancels in-person classes in response to COVID-19,
                                    SGWC will follow suit and cancel in-person sessions. Depending on the severity of circumstances, SGWC may instead offer remote sessions
                                    through

                                    we noticed that the majority of students have spring break over the week of 4/6-4/10. As such, we are considering adding a
                                    SGWC session on 3/28 to give students more time to work on their impact projects and advance their understanding of web design.

                            Before diving into their impact projects, students first heard from Cynthia Williams and Judy Asher of Ford in a live spotlight
                            discussing the importance of diversity and persistence in STEM. Cynthia and Judy earned their BSs in Mechanical Engineering 
                            and Computational Mathematics, respectively, from Michigan State before continuing on to earn MBAs and transitioning into leadership
                            positions; they each brought unique perspectives and shared valuable lessons from their journies. Emphasizing the future demand
                            for engineers and computationally-savvy problem solvers, Cynthia and Judy left quite an inspiring message: if STEM is your passion, keep
                            pushing forward and embrace a growth mindset!

                            Having brainstormed an initial list of impact project ideas last week, students then broke into groups of 2-4 to begin scaffolding
                            the HTML and styling the CSS of their very own websites investigating the connections between computer science and fields such as
                            art, drawing, animation, music, singing, sports, forensics, and investigation. Although their work is still in its early stages, 
                            the progress students made in a single Saturday was impressive! A quick walk around the room at the end of the session
                            made clear that the syntax, semantics, and structure of HTML and CSS covered in the prior four weeks of instruction had stuck.

                            Speaking of the final weeks of Spartan Girls Who Code, time flies when you're having fun! Believe it or not, we've only got a few sessions
                            of SGWC remaining: 3/14, 3/21, (possibly) 3/28 (see bulleted note above), and 4/18. That is, SGWC will <i>not</i> meet on 2/29 or 3/7 due to MSU's spring break, and
                            will not meet on 4/4 or 4/11 due to East Lansing and Okemos Public Schools' spring break.

                            On another forward-looking note, we'd like to invite all parents, siblings, and family members of 2020 SGWC students to our
                            final session from 10a-12p on Saturday, 4/18, where students will be presenting their impact projects for all to see prior to a pizza
                            luncheon for all to enjoy. We'll send out an RSVP form to parents in the coming weeks in order to gauge seating requirements and
                            plan pizza ordering &minus; but for now, be sure to save the date!

                        <p>
                            As introuduced last week, CSS is analogous to the furniture and decor in a home, while HTML comprises the
                            foundation and floorplan. By specifying <i>style rules</i> within a <code>.css</code> file, students learned
                            to efficiently customize attributes such as font, font size, text color, background color, and text alignment
                            across their <i>entire</i> webpage using only a few lines of code in this week's lesson, eliminating the tedious
                            process of setting styles one element at a time introduced last week. In some sense, style rules are like
                            a "replace all" operation; by creating a style rule for the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag in CSS, students
                            could reset the style of all paragraph text on their page in one fell swoop. Instead of replacing a string of text
                            as a "replace all" operation might do in Microsoft Word, however, a CSS rule simply replaces style!

                            Hence, this week's lesson went beyond aesthetics &minus; students learned the core programming principle of
                            minimal redundancy. Why specify a style rule on every single header in your website when you can specify it once
                            and apply it uniformly with only a few lines of code?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Students applied their new style superpowers to a handful of open-ended exercises, one of which challenged them
                            to build a website about their favorite band or musical artist. Wouldn't you say their creations <i>rocked</i>?

                           In place of this week's spotlight, students began brainstorming ideas for their impact projects, where they'll combine
                           their interest in computer science with a passion of their choice and create a website discussing the connection between
                           the two. From medicine to travel, sports to art, music to movies, and beyond, computer science finds applications
                           in nearly every avenue of 21st-century life &minus; as our students will find through their research, 
                           you can work just about anywhere as a programmer.

                            by editing the <code>style</code> attribute of their HTML tags,
                            giving them control over the visual appeal of their webpages.

                            Whereas HTML comprises the foundation of a webpage by specifying form and function, CSS
                            constitutes the wallpaper, carpet, furniture, and decor by specifying a plethora of stylistic attributes. By
                            including a <code>style</code> attribute in the tags of their HTML document and writing a handful of CSS statements,
                            students learned to change the font, font size, text color, text alignment, and background color of various webpage elements using the
                            <code>font-family</code>, <code>font-size</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>text-align</code>, 
                            and <code>background-color</code> CSS attributes, respectively.
                            To get a sense of these newfound aesthetic superpowers, check out the webpages students created this week!

                            Before diving into code, students were treated to a <i>live</i> spotlight this week, hearing from Katie Sydlik-Badgerow, an MSU alumna of the Class of 2019.
                            Instrumental in the leadership of last year's Spartan Girls Who Code program, Katie currently works as a Software Engineer with 
                            <a href="https://www.target.com/">Target</a> in
                            Minneapolis, MN. After telling her story, explaining what a day in the life of a software engineer looks like, and discussing how
                            her involvement in SGWC helped her reach where she is today, Katie opened things up for a lively Q&A session. Far from shy, students
                            made the most of their time engaging with Katie!

                            Next week, students will continue their exploration of CSS and all it has to offer &minus; as one might imagine,
                            we've only begun to scratch the surface when it comes to making use of its power. In particular,
                            students will learn how to create a separate CSS document specifying style attributes for their
                            entire webpage at once, eliminating the need to specify styles one element at a time. Until then, curious
                            students are encouraged to explore "CSS in the Wild" by pressing "F12" in their browser and investigating the
                            "Styles" tab of the Developer Tools menu as shown below. Try to find 5 CSS attributes you haven't learned about yet!

                            You'd never be able to tell we'd gotten a late start to the program if you'd seen our students breeze through
                            this week's lesson on HTML &minus; our girls brought a true Week 4 mentality to the second week of instruction. Curious,
                            excited, energetic, and driven to learn, they dove deeper into the semantics of 
                            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_html.asp"><i>HyperText Markup Language</i>, or <i>HTML</i></a>

                                    offers numerous filtered water refilling stations for use. In order to reduce our environmental footprint, we'd like to
                                    avoid providing bottled water and/or paper cups. Please label water bottles with your student's first and last name!

                            Following a lively icebreaker in which students bonded over what makes them "rockstars," we heard from 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hunicke">Robin Hunicke</a>
                            in this week's 
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lENoMZZ4mpU">spotlight</a> . Co-founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.funomena.com/">Funomena Games</a> and 
                            <a href="https://danm.ucsc.edu/faculty/robin-hunicke">Professor of Game Design at UC-Santa Cruz</a>,
                            Robin shared how programming can lead to positive impacts beyond what meets the eye. Discussing how her work as a
                            video game designer and producer helps to connect her audience through empathy and creativity, Robin encouraged us to build
                            our dreams with code!
                        </p>

                        
                        <div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">

                        <p>
                           Motivated by Robin's message, our students then dove into this week's CodeHS lesson introducing HTML, following the lead
                           of SGWC student mentors to work through a series of code-alongs and interactive exercises. Learning how to properly
                           format an HTML page using the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>,
                           <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags, then making use of the
                           <code>&lt;b&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> tags to <b>embolden</b>, <i>italicize</i> and
                           <u>underline</u> text, students formatted a web-friendly encyclopedia entry to show off their skills. Pushing further, they
                           even learned how to render links in their HTML page and assembled a list of their favorite websites!

                            Students who finished early were encouraged to explore "HTML in the wild" by making use of their web browser's Developer Tools
                            functionality &minus; by pressing "F12" or right-clicking on a webpage and selecting the "Inspect Element" menu option, students could see the source
                            HTML of <i>any</i> website on the internet. Try it at home!

                            Next week, students will learn how to embed images in their HTML pages and explore the wide world of 
                            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_css.asp"><i>CSS</i>, or <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i></a>.
                            If HTML is the blueprint to a webpage, then CSS is the furniture, wallpaper, paint, and decor inside &minus; whereas HTML defines the 
                            <i>structure</i> of a website, CSS defines the <i>aesthetics.</i> Web design is all about the relationship between form and function; 
                            next week's lesson will bring this relationship full circle!

                            If there's one takeaway from the chaotic start to our Spring 2020 installment of Girls Who Code, it's that
                            persistence certainly pays off &minus; our belated kickoff was a major success!

                            Students and mentors introduced themselves by way of an extreme rock-paper-scissors match to break the ice, then shared
                            what they've done with computers before and how they hope to combine coding with something
                            else they're passionate about in the future. To get an idea of what they'll be learning and building towards in SGWC,
                            students explored the impact projects which last year's 
                            <a href="Spring2019/junior-projects.html">junior club</a> and <a href="Spring2019/senior-projects.html">senior club</a>
                            students created, and even began to brainstorm ideas for their own impact projects!

                            Each club discussed the wide range of
                            creative activities to which programming can be applied, and got creative with code themselves to step in Fran's shoes and

                            Following this high-energy start, students were introduced to the learner profile and key attributes of a "Girl Who Codes," laid out
                            by the 
                            <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/about-us/">national Girls Who Code organization</a>
                            of which Spartan Girls Who Code is a chapter. Each club discussed the importance
                            of a growth mindset, curiosity to ask questions, and fearlessness to explore the unknown,
                            incorporating such values into a group-authored Club Contract. Much like a sport,
                            mentors emphasized how learning to code requires grit, passion, and practice &minus; but there's no doubt our girls are up for the
                            challenge!

                            Finally, students were introduced to the platform we'll be making use of this spring to teach web design: 
                            <a href="codehs.com">CodeHS</a>.
                            Trying their hand at the first module, students learned what <i>HTML</i> is and how it forms the blueprint of a webpage. Combining
                            text, media, and formatting all in one document, HyperText Markup Language (HTML) tells a web browser how to display information
                            on a website through the use of <i>tags</i>. Using the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag, students created their very own webpage to display
                            "Hello Worldwide Web!"
                        </p>

                            return with students to the main lobby following the 12:00pm conclusion of the session by 12:05pm to be picked
                            up no later than 12:15pm.

                            Parents are to use the circle driveway adjacent to the Engineering Building accessible from Red Cedar Rd., just south of the
                            intersection with S. Shaw Ln. (see map below) for drop-off and pick-up &minus; please <i>do not</i> drop
                            students off at the curb of S. Shaw Ln., as this is a busy road and will block traffic.

                            In spite of last Saturday's ice storm and the cancellation of our first planned session of Spartan Girls Who Code,
                            we look forward to welcoming our 2020 class of students to campus this weekend! We've enjoyed our winter break and 
                            used our time away from classes to prepare for an action-packed spring at SGWC &minus; we'll be hitting the ground running

                            If your student is itching to accelerate their adventure through computing this spring, we encourage you to
                            look into a brand-new program offered by the 
                            <a href="https://grandledge.lib.mi.us/">Grand Ledge Area District Library</a>:
                            "Code Club!" will run on Wednesday evenings from 6-7pm beginning January 15th. As noted on the
                            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/647905729283876/">program website</a>, 
                            the program is open to students aged 8-18, requires no prior coding knowledge, and will guide participants to create 
                            "websites, video games, apps, animations, and more." Students will even have the opportunity to earn Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts, or
                            merit badges through their participation!              
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Furthermore, we encourage curious students to explore the <a href="resources.html">SGWC Resources</a> page, and to check out the online learning
                            platform <a href="https://www.codehs.com">CodeHS</a>, which we'll be using in our course over the coming weeks. In addition, they may wish to consider
                            attending one of the <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/future-engineer/summer-programs">summer programs</a> or
                            <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/wie/k-12/programs-outreach">outreach programs</a> offered by the Michigan State College of Engineering; in particular,

                            on Saturday, 2/22 would pair nicely with the morning's SGWC lesson for a full day of fun!
