<h3>About Calli!</h3>
I'm in this group because I like to eat. I,m sure we all do but I can be very picky with my food. I don't normally eat meat but I trust a few restraunts with my meat and verey few people. I never ever eat hot dogs or hamburgers. I dont know why but I find that kind of meet unetible. Same goes with proccesed or pre cut meat. Epecially lunch meat. It's been 3,4, or 5 years since the last time I had lunch meat. I have A pet dog and two cats. My two cats are teribble little things but I love them and thats all that matters. I dont know what it would be like if i didn't have them anymore. Me and my friends are trying to make a website that gives Recomendations, Restraunts, Shows things that are Healthy v.s Unhealthy and a bit more. I am 12 years old and my birthday is in January. I lso live near Lansing Mi. Thats all you need to know about me.
