    <h1>Saves her dad!</h1>
    <p> 
      She needs a way to distract the wolves - she is not strong enough to fight them. She looks to the notebook for a possible way to distract them. She finds a magical flute in the spine of the notebook! And plays it perfectly! The wolves drift off to a deep slumber. She unties her dad. Reunited at last! They run home and live happily ever after!</p>
