    <h1>The Mountains</h1>
    <p>
      She follows the directions and heads into the dangerous mountains. She scales the mountains and follows a path. She hears howling wolves in the darkness. She comes to a fork in the path. She looks to the notebook but it is unclear where she should go. One path goes to the top of the mountain and one path goes to the wolves lair. Which path should she pursue?
