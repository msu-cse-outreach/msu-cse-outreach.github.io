    <h1>Being behind the curtain</h1>
    <h3> So when you go to a show at the theater you see ever thing on stage but you never see whats off stage. There are 20-200 people behind the scene. There are...</h3>
    <h3></h3>
    <h3>* Director</h3>
    <h3>The Director may be a permanent member of a theatre’s staff or a freelancer hired for an individual show. They may be the theatre’s Artistic Director. This person conceives, develops and implements the artistic vision for the specific performance in collaboration with designers from the different departments. This includes collaboration with and directing the cast. The Director may work with an Assistant Director, with a Choreographer, responsible for any dance or movement design, and with a Fight Director, to ensure fight scenes are carefully choreographed, rehearsed and managed.</h3>
    <h3> * Artistic Director</h3>
    <h3>The Artistic director develops and oversees the implementation of the artistic vision and focus of a production and often the overall programme presented by a theatre. Depending on the size and style of the theatre management this role maybe combined with that of the Chief Executive. The artistic director may also direct individual productions.</h3>
 
    
    </h3>
    <h3>* Stage Management</h3>
    <h3>The Stage Management team is responsible for the organisation of the backstage crews and cast during performances as well as in the rehearsal room. It is often made up of a number of different stage management positions although in smaller productions there may only be one stage manager. Stage Managers are usually associated with a company either as a permanent member of staff or as a freelancer.

      The Stage Manager is the most senior member of the Stage Management Team and is responsible for the health and safety of the performers and crew for every performance as well as for ensuring all departments have completed their tasks for the production to be performed during both the rehearsal and performance periods. This includes pre-show checks, particularly safety checks, including at fight or movement rehearsals.

      The primary role of the Deputy Stage Manager is to call the show. Following the prompt book (the full script along with the prompts and cues for the performers as well as lighting, sound and scene changes), they talk to the department operators and technicians over a head set to co-ordinate the show. They will also use a public address system to summon the actors from their dressing rooms and to co-ordinate with front of house when the performance is about to start.

      Assistant Stage Managers are the most junior members of the team, organising props and assisting with set and costume changes. The may also cover roles such as Dressers and Mechanists. Other duties include preparing the rehearsal room and stage.
    </h3>
    <h3>* Technical Department</h3>
    <h3>This team manages technical aspects of a show covering sound, lighting and AV. This including the safe and effective use of equipment such as lights, projectors, speakers and microphones.

      Every venue has a Technical Manager although this role may be combined with operational roles depending on the size of the venue. They are responsible for the up-keep and maintenance of the technical equipment for the venue. They may also act as liaison with visiting companies providing them with technical information including venue plans and safety requirements when using the venue.

      Operators are usually technicians who know how to work with the technical equipment such as a lighting board, computer or sound desk to ‘plot’ the technical cues on and then operate during the show. The usually sit in the control box so that they can see the stage.
  </h3><h3>* Designers</h3>
  <h3>These are the key creatives who alongside the Director or create the setting for the production, allowing the audience to believe they are in a different place or time. Sometimes the different designer roles overlap with one another or with technical roles, depending on the size of the production. They are generally freelance roles that are hired for a specific performance although some theatres will recruit for long term positions.

    Set Designers design the set and Costume Designers design the costumes for a production. The positions can be combined for smaller productions. In that case the person responsible is known as a Theatre Designer. Set Designers work with the Production Manager, Stage Managers and Carpenters in the workshop to build the set according to a set of plans, working drawings and scale model, and to make sure the props work with the design concept and needs of the performance. Costume Designers work with the Production Manager, Stage Manager and Wardrobe to source and create the costumes. Theatre Designers may do their own construction and sourcing if the company or theatre does not have a workshop or wardrobe.

    Lighting Designers create the lighting for a show, contributing to the overall atmosphere of a production and helping to create the impression of different times of day. Sound Designers are responsible for how a production sounds, including creating sound effects and making sure the show sounds as good as it can for the audience.
