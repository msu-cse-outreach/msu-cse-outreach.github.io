    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Cujo is a psychological horror flim and novel by Stephen King, about a rabid dog. On Stephen King trip to a mechanic during "the spring of 1977" he had issues with his motorcycle which led him to visit a auto shop in Bridgton, Main. He said his motorcycle died when he arrived at the shop, and moments later a Saint Bernard came growling and eventually lunged for his hand. Although the mechanic stopped the dog by hitting it with a wrench, King was still startled by the situation. This incident inspired King to make Cujo.  </p>
