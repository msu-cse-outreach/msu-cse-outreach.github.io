      <strong>The impact of car washes!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Most soaps contain harmful chemicals. The pollution problem is only compounded when the soapy water is mixed with the grime, dirt and grease removed from a vehicle. Most washes use at least <strong>40 gallons</strong> of water for a single car. The water runoff inevitably has to go somewhere, usually a nearby storm drain. This runoff, depending on location, ends up in either our water treatment centers or larger bodies of water. The former affects the water we drink and the latter affects animals and crops. Regardless of who the pollution directly affects, it is definitely not good. </p>

    <p>On the flip side, not washing your car can also leave an environmental footprint. Any water discharge from a dirty car will leave a polluted trail. It is imperative to keep your vehicle clean, and clean it in an environmentally friendly way. If you don't want to hurt the envirment but you still want to keep your car clean there is an easy step you can take, <strong>It's as simple as reparking your car.</strong> When washing your car instead of having your car parked in the drive way, park it in the grass. This will send the water and other liquds into the ground where it will be filtered out into into pure,distilled water. So next time you need to wash your car take the extra step and do it in you yard. </p>
