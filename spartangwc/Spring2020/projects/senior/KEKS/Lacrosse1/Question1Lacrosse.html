    In womens lacrosse they use goggles, mouthgard,lacrosse sticks, and gloves.
    </p>
    Fun fact: 
    <ul>
    <li>They use goggles to protect their eyes from being hit in the face with a ball or stick</li>
      <li>They use mouthgards to protect their teeth from balls and sticks, the mouthgard has to be a color so the referee can see it. It can't be clear</li>
    </ul>
