                    Last Saturday marked the end of the Spring 2021 edition of Spartan Girls Who Code. Yet Saturday was only the beginning of something bigger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Saturday marked the end of one leg in our journey toward learning computer science, but was not the final destination. Learning to code is a lifelong journey&mdash;even our mentors and advisors are still years away from the destination! That's the beauty of computer science, though&mdash;no matter who you are, how old you are, where you're from, or what you do, you can embark on the journey, learning and growing with each step. The destination may be the long-term goal, but it isn't the short-term point. The challenges you overcome, the views you enjoy, and the friends you make are. Enjoying the journey is what it's all about&mdash;and we've certainly done that with you all this spring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                    We'd like to thank our students for their energy and enthusiasm; our students' parents for their ongoing support and encouragement; our mentors for making each Saturday exciting, engaging, and entertaining; and our advisors for their organization, coordination and commitment to making SGWC a reality. Without you all, we wouldn't be here.
                    </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we dive into a full recap of our final meeting, we've got a few announcements.
                </p>
                <h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
                <ul>
                    <h4>1. Feedback</h4>
                    <p>
                        Your feedback helps us improve Spartan Girls Who Code year after year! Let us know what you thought of this spring's edition by filling out the <a href="https://forms.gle/3AmLigEu8TT9dC858">parent post-survey</a>. If your student didn't have a chance to share their feedback at our final meeting by filling out the <a href="https://forms.gle/aBZKRBkUxd7AtbWi8">student post-survey</a>, please encourage them to do so, too!
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. Looking Ahead</h4>
                    <p>
                        Saturday, 3/27 marked the final meeting of Spartan Girls Who Code for the spring. Thanks for making it such a blast!
                    </p>
                    <h4>3. Summer Camp</h4>
                    <p>
                        We're in the early stages of planning a virtual computer science summer camp in late July, so stay tuned for more information! We'll be sure to email you all when logistics are finalized and registration opens&mdash;if you participated in Spring 2021 SGWC, you're on our mailing list!
                    </p>
                    <h4>4. Future Programs</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our group (<a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/wie/">Women in Engineering</a> + <a href="https://cse.msu.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>)  runs <a href="http://www.spartangwc.org/">Spartan Girls Who Code</a> each spring, and <a href="http://technovation.cadl.org/">Technovation</a> each fall. We'll be sure to let you know when registration for each program opens&mdash;again, if you participated in Spring 2021 SGWC, you're on our mailing list!
                    </p>
                    <h4>5. Further Learning</h4>
                    <p>
                        We know how enthusiastic you've all been this spring, and imagine many of you hope to continue learning to code on your own this spring/summer. If you haven't finished the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Intro to JS: Drawing &amp; Animation</a> course we worked through this spring, that's a great place to start! If you have, we highly recommend you check out the other <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming">Computer Programming</a> courses offered by Khan Academy. Also, check out our <a href="resources.html">resources</a> page for more ideas!
                    </p>
                    <h4>6. Questions?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As always, please reach out with any questions / concerns / ideas / feedback to <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.
                    </p>
                </ul>
                <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
                <p>
                    Following a personality quiz icebreaker, we jumped into a special-edition spotlight for our final meeting featuring our very own mentors. Each shared a piece of advice and encouragement with our students, reminding them that <b>they belong in computer science</b> and <b>are capable of accomplishing anything they set their mind to!</b>
                </p>

                        <p><i>Join us in thanking the hard work of our Spring 2021 Spartan Girls Who Code mentors!</i></p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>
                    The true highlight of our meeting came after the mentor spotlight, though, when the spotlight was turned on our students. Parents, siblings and fellow students explored a virtual gallery of other students' projects on Gather in our Final Project Fair. While we certainly wish we could've hosted the fair in-person, we enjoyed being able to "walk around" our Gather space for a change of pace from Zoom!

                                I was the advisor for computer science major for over ten years. In this role, I met with hundreds of students and it was evident there were barely any women and other underrepresented students in the major. This spurred me and a colleague to help start a book club, which eventually became our MSU Women in Computing club. I also helped start a statewide conference called MICWIC and a non-profit organization, iTEC. The aim of these programs was to increase the diversity in CS. As a result of my work, the Dean created my current position and asked me to take on this role.

                                I came to the USA with a B.S degree in Pharmacy in 1990. We relocated and resided in East Lansing MI&mdash;MSU did not have a Graduate School program for Pharmacy, so I decided to pursue another degree. I love Mathematics and Physics so I decided to attend college for the second time, this time pursuing Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I then continued to pursue my graduate degree in this area.

                                I'm a Professor Emeritus&mdash;which means I'm retired! At MSU, I mainly taught introduction to programming and software engineering. In the last 5 years before retiring, I created and taught the <a href="http://www.cse.msu.edu/~ldillon/cse-ctl/">Computational Thinking Lab</a>. I LOVED teaching this class and recruited many Technovation and SGWC mentors from it. Now I work with MSU mentors and Teresa and Sebnem on coding clubs. I also volunteer for many programs of the National Center for Women in Information Technology (NCWIT).

                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science, and how did you get to where you are today?</b><br>
                                Completely by accident. I was studying math at University of Michigan, when I decided to take a year off to see the USA. In that year, I had a chance to teach programming in the business school at Eastern Montana College. Learning Cobol and Basic a week before my students was a bit harrowing, but I really liked programming. I liked problem-solving and I liked that programming was <b>useful</b> (a common "use" given for homology theory was showing that you can't comb a hairy ball flat without creating a cowlick!). When my graduate advisor died unexpectedly while I was away, I decided to switch both majors and schools. I got my PhD in CS from UMass Amherst five years later. I taught at UMass the next year since delivering a baby within a semester of starting a new job didn't sound like a smart thing to do. The following year I took a job at University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB), where I taught and did research in software engineering, and my husband started a PhD program in the ecology of lakes. We ended up back in Michigan 12 years later when MSU solved our two-body problem by offering both my husband and I jobs. As a professor at MSU, I got to travel the world to give talks and teach programming and software engineering. A favorite was <a href="http://rwandancampforgirlsinit.blogspot.com/">three summer camps for secondary school girls and their teachers in Rwanda!</a>

                                The coders! Especially coders who don't have a clue at the start and are amazed to learn what they can do with code by the end. It is so much fun to see the light gradually turn on! I love seeing them gain confidence as they realize that programming just takes practice.

                    Can you believe there's only one more week of Spartan Girls Who Code? We can't either!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're going to miss spending Saturday mornings together with you all. In the meantime, though, we're looking forward to making the most of one last meeting this Saturday! Last Saturday's meeting was a high note&mdash;let's end the Spring 2021 Spartan Girls Who Code session on an even higher one this week!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we dive into a full recap of last Saturday's meeting, we've got a few announcements.

                        Join us at this week's Bonus Hour on
                        <b>Thursday, 3/25 from 3:30-4:30p ET</b>, open to all SGWC participants.
                        Two SGWC mentors will be available on Gather during the bonus hour&mdash;this is a great opportunity for 1:1 discussion and support on final projects!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll host the bonus hour on Gather&mdash;see the email we sent last Friday, 3/19

                    <p>
                        We'd like to give students the chance to show off their impressive final projects from SGWC, and invite you to join us for a (virtual) final project fair <b>this Saturday, 3/27 between 10a-12p</b>! The virtual fair will take place during our usual meeting time, and <b>we encourage parents and siblings to join us.</b> Students will be participating in an icebreaker and spotlight between 10-10:45, but will be available to show you around between 10:45-11:30ish.
                    </p>

                <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
                <p>
                    In preparation for next Saturday's final project fair, we kicked off last Saturday's meeting with a "Project Show and Tell" icebreaker. Students shared rough drafts of their final projects, exchanged ideas, traded compliments, drew inspiration from one another, and had a blast showing off their hard work!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'd like to keep our students' creations a surprise for the final project fair, so we'll hold off on including any previews in this week's newsletter. Of course, you're always welcome to ask your own student to share what they've been working on! What did they have to say in response to this week's discussion questions?
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style: disc">Did you decide to do a spin off or a new project?</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc">What do you want to try to add on today?</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc">What part was the easiest so far?</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc">Is there a part that's been tricky to figure out?</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc">What is your favorite part of your project so far?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following show-and-tell, we dove into an interactive spotlight highlighting the broad intersection between art, games and computer science. Computer science is often perceived as meticulous and monotonous&mdash;yet in reality, this stereotype is far from the truth. In fact, code empowers creativity, a colorful imagination, and an anything-is-possible spirit!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students saw this first hand on Saturday by exploring Google's <a href="https://www.autodraw.com/">AutoDraw</a> and <a href="https://g.co/arts/xaPj9bAG1Ehu7mDY8">Puzzle Party</a>, an artistic <a href="https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/">Fluid Simulation</a> engine, and the open-ended, create-your-own-world <a href="https://sandspiel.club/">Sandspiel</a> environment. Ask them to show you their favorite site&mdash;and while you're at it, ask why they think creativity is important in computer science!

                    After our spotlight, students continued working on their final projects, adding finishing touches and getting their code in tip-top shape for next Saturday's final project fair. We can't wait to see you there&mdash;we promise you'll be impressed! Our students have done amazing work over the last 9 weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking of the final project fair: our Gather space is decked out and looking good! Hannah, one of our lead mentors, did an amazing job decorating and setting up "interactive" posters which display students' final projects. During the final project fair, students, parents, and siblings will be able to explore this space, walking between posters and viewing a variety of final projects.

                                <b>What are you studying?</b><br>
                                I am a junior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Graphic Design!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                In high school, I stumbled upon a video of the animation process of a Pixar movie, and that was when I realized that there was a way that I could combine my art skills and science! This is what got me interested in computer science and ever since then, I have found out that there are so many possibilities in computer science that involve using the same creative process as in art.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                                I have been able to develop algorithms with a research team that can be used on a physical robot to help a human solve problems more creatively in a social setting!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                                I am hoping to use artificial intelligence to build better assistive technology that can help persons with disabilities, but my interests and possibilities are endless.

                    In today's world of uncertainty, it can be quite intimidating to plan for the road ahead. College&mdash;and ultimately a career&mdash;may feel ages away, and may seem to bring nothing but stress. This week, however, we were reminded it's all a matter of perspective. MSU alumna Zosha Korzecke joined us for an insightful live spotlight, unpacking her journey in computer science and encouraging students to follow their passions, whether they are in computer science or elsewhere. The road ahead is indeed long and winding&mdash;but that's what makes the journey enjoyable!

                <p>
                    At this point, you can probably recite our weekly meeting routine&mdash;so it's about time we switched things up! This week's meeting featured our first-ever <b>live, virtual spotlight</b> presentation by Zosha Korzecke, a December 2020 MSU graduate, former Spartan Girls Who Code Mentor, and current Software Engineer at Google!
                </p>
                <p>
                   To wake up for the morning and give Zosha the chance to meet students in small group settings, we opened our meeting with a "Would You Rather?" icebreaker powered by <a href="https://jamboard.google.com/">Google Jamboard</a>, a collaboration platform similar to Google Slides. Mentors shared would-you-rather questions over Gather and Zoom, and students moved a virtual sticky note with their name on it between option (a) and option (b) on the Jamboard to indicate their preference. Before moving between questions, mentors and participants shared their thoughts out loud, debating the relative merits of option (a) over option (b), and vice-versa. All in all, the icebreaker was a hit!

                <p>
                    A few of the most popular questions are listed below. They'll make for an interesting dinner table conversation!
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style: disc">Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck?</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc">Would you rather have an elephant-sized hamster or a hamster-sized elephant?</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc">Would you rather have a pet alligator or a pet talking almond?</li>
                        <li style="list-style: disc">Do you think you would last longer against a shark or a tiger?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a silly icebreaker and plenty of laughs behind us, we jumped right into Zosha's spotlight&mdash;and we were blown away. Zosha's wisdom, optimism and encouragement spoke to students and mentors alike, inspiring us all in a time where it's all too easy to become discouraged. Sharing her journey which combines a passion for art with a passion for computer science, she reminded us that anything is possible with code&mdash;the only limits are the ones we impose on ourselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Zosha also introduced the notion of <a href="https://ucsdguardian.org/2019/05/12/impostor-syndrome-computer-science/">imposter syndrome</a> in computer science, in which a programmer feels she's not as smart or capable as those around her, and shared tips for overcoming such thoughts. Perhaps most importantly, Zosha reminded us that <b>we all belong</b> in computer science, despite whatever stereotypes, expectations, or social constructs may make us feel we're not the "typical" computer scientist. It's about time we changed the face of computer science!

                   After spotlight, students jumped back into their final projects and spent the remaining meeting time building and tweaking their creations. Some students even finished their first final project idea and began a second creation! Mentors floated between groups, checking in to make sure students were on track to finish by the end of next week's 3/20 meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                   We can't wait for students to share their creations with parents and siblings at the Final Project Fair on 3/27! Stay tuned for more details regarding the Final Project Fair in next week's newsletter.

                                <b>What are you studying?</b><br>
                                I am a junior studying Computer Science with a double minor in French and Mathematics!
                            </p>

                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                I became interested in computer science when I joined my high school girls coding club. That was when I was exposed to the versatility and different possibilities programming offered. I learned that it could be applied in any field (this was nice for me because I had multiple interests) and could be used to solve real world problems.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                                Some cool things I've done with computer science include (i) programming a robot that could recycle, and (ii) making a website that helped me share my experiences about the importance of studying abroad.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                                In the future I really hope to use computer science to combine my love of helping people and fashion design. I would love to develop software that can have a positive impact on people's lives. I would also love to create applications that could push the work of inclusive clothing and fashion lines.

                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                I became interested in computer science after realizing how flexible of a field it can be. Unlike many other STEM fields, computer science can be used for your own hobbies and interests. That versatility is what drew me to it.

                                My hobby is perfumery (making custom perfumes), so I started a blog about different perfumery ingredients and my experiences with them!

                                <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                                There is a disconnect between the fragrance world and computers, so I am always looking for ways to bridge this gap. Designing bottles, finding ways to simulate scents without having to waste ingredients and much more! There is a lot of work to be done in this realm so I’m excited to see where it takes me.

                    It's one thing to train for a marathon, and another to race in one&mdash;preparation is essential, yet it still takes a leap of faith to lace up and set out for 26.2 miles. Making the transition from structured exercises to open-ended creation in computer science requires the same leap of faith!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Students took this leap at Saturday's meeting, diving into the nitty-gritty of planning and implementing their final projects.

                <p>
                    Although this week's focus shifted away from new content and toward final projects, the learning, growth and laughter never left! Students and mentors alike continued to bond, collaborate, and build community with one another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our icebreaker was a comedic gold mine, giving students and mentors alike plenty to laugh about. Individuals created so-called "meme slides" containing memes/images/gifs capturing their reactions to the one-year anniversary of life in the pandemic, their excitement for spring, and their thoughts on returning to in-person classes. The future is beginning to look brighter!

                    This week's spotlight traded the usual video format for a more interactive one, encouraging students to engage with examples of cutting-edge computer science in the real world. In breakout rooms, students explored the many computer science "experiments" on the <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/">Experiments With Google</a> website, sharing their favorites with the group and discussing how each experiment applies the ideas we've covered in SGWC. When first learning how to code, it's easy to get lost in the abstraction of variables, loops, functions and syntax&mdash;it's refreshing to zoom out and remember what computer science is all about!

                    After spotlight, students learned how to add images to their drawings through a mentor-led code-along and dove back into the process of project planning. Building on their ideas from last week's final project brainstorm, students created must/should/like lists to narrow their project's scope, and determined a starting point from which to start coding. Check out the example must/should/like list from this week below to get a sense of the real-world project management skills students are putting into practice!

                    At the conclusion of Saturday's meeting, students shared project progress, resolved project challenges, and reflected on how far we've all come over the course of the spring. Just seven weeks ago, many of our students had never seen JavaScript. Now, they're creating their very own works of art with code!

                <p>
                    Student feedback remains positive, and we get the feeling that everyone's enjoying the final project so far. That said, there's always room for us to improve&mdash;send us a note at <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a> with any suggestions!

                    The only limit in life is our imagination&mdash;and that's especially true when it comes to coding! If you can dream it, chances are you can make it with a bit of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Often, the trickiest challenge in computer science is deciding <i>what</i> to create and <i>why</i> in the first place&mdash;once that's figured out, it's only a matter of time and energy to make it happen! This week, our students practiced the important art of thinking big, brainstorming ideas for their final projects and exploring uncharted territory.

                <p>
                    Spring has sprung, and the energy was evident throughout Saturday's meeting, beginning with our icebreaker. Show and tell never fails to spur conversation and connection between mentors and students, yet this Saturday was especially lively. We bonded over our favorite shows, movies, books, music and hobbies, reminding us that physical distance and social connection are not mutually exclusive! We're not alone&mdash;we have a lot more in common with one another than we realize, whether we're six feet or six miles apart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This week's spotlight focused on the importance of teamwork in computer science, and emphasized why diverse teams are the best teams&mdash;the more perspectives we have at the table in technology, the better! Individuals with different backgrounds bring different experiences and skills to a team, helping their team face the wide range of unpredictable challenges that arise when developing new technology. Computer science has historically been a relatively homogeneous, white-male-dominated field, but that needs to change if we hope to solve the toughest problems of tomorrow. Hear what Russell Wilson, Aloe Blacc, Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Chris Paul and others have to say about the many opportunities computer science brings, and the importance of "changing the face of computer science" in the <a href="https://youtu.be/uhcA6K8rWp0">video produced by Code.org.</a>
                <p>
                    Ask your student what they thought of the video! Why do they think diversity and teamwork are important in computer science?

                    Following our spotlight, students began brainstorming ideas for their final projects, in which they'll apply the expertise they've developed over the course of SGWC to make a drawing or animation using JavaScript. Students have recreated and replicated drawings and animations through Khan Academy assignments&mdash;but now, we're encouraging them to blaze their own trail to make an original creation. We're excited to see what they come up with!

Keep up the awesome work, everyone!

                                I am a freshman studying Computer Engineering along with a minor in Japanese!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                Growing up I liked to question why technology based products (phones, computers, cameras, etc.) worked. Eventually, I had what felt like a million questions and no answers. In order to gain some understanding I decided to dedicate my time to studying technology in order to get some long awaited answers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                                I created a program that read through data gathered about Covid patients in the US, and then printed a month by month visual representation of the deaths and expected deaths caused by the virus.

                                <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                                I’ve been trying to learn Japanese, and a barrier that I’ve constantly faced is not always having access to a speaking partner (due to a large time difference). This has inspired me to want to create an artificially intelligent language partner.

                                <b>What are you studying?</b><br>
                                I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Game Design!

                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                I always knew I wanted to do work involving computers but I didn't know if I wanted to work in hardware or software. This changed my freshman year where I became hooked on computer science.

                            <p>
                                <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                                I've used computer science to code various video games I've made for my classes!
                            </p>

                                <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                                I'm hoping to use computer science in the future to code more games that others will enjoy, just like the games I used to play as a child!

                    The warm weather, blue skies and sunshine have us springing to life this week, just like our code! Students learned to animate their JavaScript drawings at Saturday's meeting, bringing their once-static creations out of hibernation and into motion. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/groundhog-day-2021-punxsutawney-phil-predicts-6-more-weeks-of-winter/">Perhaps Punxsutawney Phil was wrong this year</a>&mdash;it's feeling like winter is on its way out!

                <p>
                    Bingo may be <a href="https://www.casino.org/blog/how-did-bingo-originate-the-history-of-bingo-explained/">nearly 500 years old</a>, but that didn't stop us from having a blast playing it at this week's icebreaker! Call us old-fashioned&mdash;but it's hard to beat a classic. Checking off tiles like "has a pet," "plays video games," and "likes to listen to music" as they were called, students connected with each other and with mentors by discussing their favorite books, movies, sports, hobbies, music and games. It turns out our SGWC family has a lot in common! Spin up your own game of icebreaker bingo using our cards at <a href="https://bingobaker.com#c65a4862af01287a">this link.</a>

                    Conveniently, one of our icebreaker bingo tiles&mdash;"likes Disney"&mdash;tied perfectly into this week's spotlight! Focused on women in tech at Disney, the spotlight video reminded us how technology and creativity go hand-in-hand in the 21st century. To be an effective technologist, it's important to think creatively, and to be an effective creator, it's important to use the tools offered by modern technology. In fact, Disney doesn't even hire "engineers"&mdash;they hire "Imagineers!" After all, Disney's greatest challenges don't have a single correct answer like the problems from a textbook&mdash;they require outside-the-box thinking and a bit of imagination.
                <p>
                    Hear what Disney's women technologists have to say about their work at Disney <a href="https://youtu.be/xpBRiOB-HI8">here</a>,
                    and ask your student what they thought about the video!

                    Back by popular demand, we followed this week's spotlight with a friendly game of Kahoot reviewing the JavaScript content from Khan Academy we've covered thus far. The Kahoot is available <a href="https://create.kahoot.it/share/week-5-sgwc-21/e3cd92a5-1d76-42df-8cdf-7ac188d37a74">here</a> if your student is looking for a fun way to check their understanding!

                <p>
                    For the second half of the meeting, students jumped back into the Khan Academy <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">"Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation"</a> course, learning how to take their drawings to the next level with animation. Making use of <i>variables</i> introduced at last week's meeting, students brought their drawings to life by dynamically changing the positions and sizes of objects with code. Did someone say Pixar is hiring?

                                My mom is a software developer, so I was always interested in what she did growing up. I took a computer science class in high school and loved it from there!

                                I've done lots of cool things with computer science, but one thing that stands out is using computer science to analyze statistics&mdash;it's much easier to analyze large sets of data and come up with new models.

                    In life and in code, adaptability is key! The world is constantly changing, and we must
                    change along with it&mdash;the past year has been a prime example.
                    While it can be difficult to change ourselves, it's far easier to change our code&mdash;thanks
                    to the power of <i>variables</i>, we can change an entire program by changing a single number.

                        Pharrell Williams, Georgia Tech and Amazon are hosting a coding competition at the intersection
                        of tech, music and racial equity this spring on the

                <p>
                    When's the last time you participated in show-and-tell? For our students, it was Saturday!
                    We kicked off our meeting with a virtual spin on the long-time classic, and had an absolute blast.
                    Indeed, show-and-tell was the perfect way to jumpstart Saturday's session&mdash;students shared
                    mementos, trophies and photos, explaining the story behind them and building connections
                    with one another across a wide range of topics.
                    It was nice to see those who were comfortable turning on their camera when sharing!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the icebreaker, we learned how girls can change the world with code in this week's
                    spotlight video, featuring Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki and Nobel Peace
                    Prize Winner Malala Yousafzai. From software and web development to e-commerce, finance, business,
                    gaming, fashion, science, security, and beyond, the video reinforced why learning to code is so
                    important in 2021: code is everywhere! Students shared where they hope to take their coding
                    skills in the future, spurring a wonderful discussion and
                    building community on the basis of shared interests.

                    Before jumping into new content on Khan Academy, we reviewed the core concepts of programming and
                    JavaScript that we've covered so far with a friendly game of Kahoot.
                    If your student wants to test their memory or challenge a friend to a game of coding trivia, they
                    can access the Kahoot at <a href="https://create.kahoot.it/share/week-4-sgwc21/cb74f629-d3d4-48f5-9ce1-9c9d463ffaea">this link</a>!

                <p>
                    In this week's module of the Khan Academy
                    <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">"Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation"</a>
                    course, students worked with variables to make their creations more adaptive:
                    variables allow students to change their entire drawing by changing a
                    single number in their code. A few of our students' creations from this week are shown below.

                    We wrapped up Saturday's meeting with a discussion of past accomplishments, present progress,
                    and future goals in small groups, followed by the weekly feedback survey.
                    Gather, Zoom and Khan Academy seem to be working well&mdash;in spite of the many lemons
                    of the past year, it's safe to say SGWC has made lemonade.
                    Our arrangement may not be perfect, but we're happy to see students are happy!

                <p>

                    we can improve!

                                I'm a freshman studying Computer Science Engineering and Information Science with a minor in Spanish!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                I became interested in Computer Science my sophomore year of high school, which is when I took my first coding class. I really enjoyed the combination of logic and creativity
                                that's important when writing code.
                            </p>

                                <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                                I wrote a program that can take any DNA
                                strand and return its corresponding protein sequence, which was really fun since I love
                                learning about genetics. I have also designed some websites!
                            </p>

                                <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                                I hope to go into full-stack software development in order to combine design and coding!

                                <b>What are you studying?</b><br>
                                I'm a second-year graduate student pursuing a Dual Ph.D. in Computer Science and Ecology, Evolution &amp; Behavior.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                I became interested in computer science in middle school when I saw all the things you
                                could do with it. At the time I thought about creating video games,
                                but now I focus on artificial intelligence (AI)!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                                I've created an evolving AI model that plays the board game Mancala.
                                It was able to beat me sometimes!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                                In the future I hope to use computer science to create AIs that can solve
                                complicated problems. I also hope to continue to do outreach with it, as computer
                                science opens a lot of doors.

                    A small splash of color can make a big difference.
                    By learning to color with code in this week's lesson, students moved beyond the
                    basics of black and white into a world of vibrant reds,
                    lively greens, bright blues and other hues!

                    We kicked off Saturday's meeting with a fan-favorite icebreaker: meme slides! Each student
                    described their week with a series of memes, gifs and other images, and the results were hilarious,
                    as always. As you might imagine, we're all a bit fed up with the polar vortex and the
                    pandemic&mdash;but that hasn't put a damper on our sense of humor!

                    This week's spotlight featured Kim Swennen, an actress-turned-coder who made a mid-career
                    pivot to tech and now works on the YouTube "Subscribe" button!
                    Kim's story highlights the fact that anyone can learn to code at any time,
                    regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, background, age, or circumstance.
                    Whether or not students pursue computer science as a career or
                    go a different route, we hope they remember Kim's courage to redefine herself and do what
                    makes them happy.

                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                I became interested in computer science through a class I took on
                                <a href="https://codehs.com/">CodeHS</a> in high school!
                                In college I decided on CS when I realized I enjoyed creating projects
                                more than studying only for exams.
                            </p>

                                I created a Pokémon battle game!

                                I am hoping to use CS for cybersecurity.
                                There are so many possibilities though, and I am excited to continue to explore them!

                                <b>What are you studying?</b><br>
                                I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science Engineering and Japanese,
                                and minoring in Spanish!

                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                I became interested in computer science because of my interest in foreign languages
                                and problem solving. Computer science is filled with so many different programming
                                languages! Just like Spanish or French, for example, programming languages are
                                constructed in different ways, but can serve similar purposes,
                                and I think that’s pretty cool.
                            </p>

                                <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                                I have worked on programming projects with people all around the world,
                                and have written code for mobile applications.
                            </p>

                                <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                                This is a good question. It is hard to pick one specific thing I hope to do,
                                because I have a wide range of interests! I do, however, think it would be fun to work
                                on applications or devices that can be used to improve interpretation/translation
                                in hospitals and/or for personal foreign language study.

                <p>
                    To begin, we re-introduced the key functionalities of Gather and reviewed
                    the layout of our virtual office space for the spring.
                    Without wasting any time, we then jumped into our icebreaker for the week: lightning conversations!
                    Students scattered throughout the rows of desks in our space in groups of 3-4,
                    and mentors joined each group for a quick round of "would you rather"-style questions.
                    Each row of desks in our Gather office is a "private space,"
                    which allowed mentors and students to connect in small groups without having to worry about the
                    70+ other meeting participants!
                    After a few minutes of conversation, students and mentors shuffled to meet a new group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We then jumped into Zoom calls to watch this week's spotlight, featuring Jordyn Castor.
                    An <a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10157255751547256&id=160252487255">MSU alumna</a>
                    and current software engineer at Apple, Jordyn has been blind since birth and works to make
                    technology more accessible! Inspired by Jordyn, students reflected on the actions they can take to
                    make the world around them more inclusive.
                    Check out the video by searching for "accessible"
                    at <a href="https://www.ifthencollection.org/women-tech">this link</a>, and ask your student what they thought!

                    Following our icebreaker and spotlight, students were off to the races on Khan Academy,
                    working through the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">
                    "Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation"</a> course in small groups.
                    Using code to draw a smiley face and a snowman, students learned how code can indeed be creative.
                    Just as learning to sing, dance, paint or sculpt
                    opens up a whole new world of creative possibilities, learning to code does the same!

                    We ended things with small mentor-student group discussions, reflecting on what went well,
                    what was challenging, and what students are looking forward to at next Saturday's session.

                                I became interested in computer science during a web development class in high school,
                                and from there on out I just loved coding! I loved connecting coding with the design
                                aspects of web development and creating cool looking websites.

                                Something cool that I have done with computer science is program a Tower Balloon defense
                                game where animated balloons follow a road, and you move the towers to pop as many balloons as you can!
                                It was the first big project in college where at the end, I felt very accomplished looking at the final product,
                                and I very much enjoyed making it.

                                I'm into application development, website development, data science...
                                so I don't know what I want to do quite yet.
                                I am also interested in continuing my education past undergrad and possibly going to grad school!

                                I became interested in Computer Science through my high school robotics team.
                                I really enjoyed programming the robot to make it achieve different tasks and move autonomously.

                                I have built a couple of iPhone apps and made a few card games.

                                In the future I am hoping to do something with cybersecurity or artificial intelligence.
                                Whatever I end up doing, I hope to make a positive impact on the world!

                            Students were encouraged to fill out the

                            at Saturday's meeting, but not everyone submitted their responses.
                            If your student has not yet completed the pre-survey,
                            please have them do so before this Saturday's meeting.

                        <h4>4. Bonus Hour</h4>
                        <p>
                            Back from <a href="http://technovation.cadl.org/">Technovation</a> by popular demand, we'll be hosting
                            a SGWC "bonus hour" every <b>Thursday from 3:30-4:30p ET</b>
                            (beginning this Thursday, 1/28) open to all SGWC
                            participants. Two SGWC mentors will be available on Gather during the bonus hour
                            to resolve technical difficulties, dive deeper into the coding concepts we've learned,
                            or to talk about computer science in general!

                    <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
                    <p>
                        Mentors welcomed participants within the lobby of our very own virtual SGWC office,
                        just as we used to do in the lobby of the Engineering Building on MSU's campus!
                        As much as we miss seeing everyone in person, the organic,
                        small group exchanges like these helped make Saturday's meeting feel a little more normal.
                        Our decorations may be 8-bit, but our
                        <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather</a>
                        space felt like a real computer lab!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To become familiar with the functionalities of Gather and the layout of our virtual space,
                        participants worked through a <a href="https://forms.gle/1gqMyyE647gHGycx9">scavenger hunt</a>.
                        Each station on the scavenger hunt was staffed by a handful of mentors,
                        giving mentors and participants the chance to meet one another.
                        Because Gather connects video and audio to others nearby in the virtual space,
                        participants were able to group up and make new friends along the way.
                        Ask your student to give you a tour of our virtual home for the spring!

                        Following the scavenger hunt, participants completed a program pre-survey which will help us
                        evaluate and improve SGWC in future years.
                        We've learned a lot from pre- and post-surveys in past years&mdash;we truly
                        appreciate our participants' thoughtful feedback! If your student did not complete the
                        pre-survey, please encourage them to do so <a href="https://forms.gle/Lirc5MRBUmoRgeQT8">at this link</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, participants and mentors broke out into three
                        <i>cohorts</i>&mdash;Junior 1, Junior 2 and Senior&mdash;to discuss the journey ahead of
                        us in SGWC and the logistics involved.
                        Each cohort collaborated to write a club contract setting goals and expectations for
                        future meetings, and set up Khan Academy accounts for use in the coming weeks.
                        We'll be working through the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">
                            "Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation"
                        </a>
                        course offered by Khan Academy beginning this Saturday!

                    <p>
                        Finally, we encouraged participants to fill out an end-of-meeting survey to gauge
                        comfort with Gather, and received overwhelmingly positive responses!
                        It's always scary to try something new, so we were glad to hear students enjoyed the new platform.
                        That said, we want to make sure <i>everyone</i> has a great time at SGWC this spring&mdash;so
                        if you're having issues with Gather, please send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.

                    <p>
                        This spring, we'll be including a new section in our weekly newsletter: the Mentor Spotlight!
                        SGWC is led, organized, and run by MSU students with the help of
                        <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/ldillon">Dr. Laura Dillon</a>
                        and

                        and we thought it would be fun to
                        introduce a few of our <a href="contact.html#team">team members</a> each week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To kick off our mentor spotlight series, we'd like to introduce the Spring 2021 Lead Mentors!

                                    I've done a lot of cool things with computer science, from making games like tic-tac-toe
                                    and rock-paper-scissors, to designing an app that detects texting and driving.

                                    I became interested in CS through a outreach program similar to GWC,
                                    hosted by Google with Dr. Dillon (woot woot!) and another professor at MSU.

                                    mechanical or electrical engineering until high school. FIRST robotics
                                    and AP Computer Science led me to develop an interest in code.

                    <h4>4. Gather.Town</h4>
                    <p>
                        Let's face it: we're all tired of Zoom these days.
                        So, we'll be using a new platform for the Spring 2021 session of SGWC:
                        <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather</a>.
                        We think it will make for a great online learning experience!
                        You can find more information in Gather's
                        <a href="https://gather.town/docs">documentation</a>, but we provide a brief summary below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gather is built around the idea of virtual proximity:
                        you can move into and out of conversations in a virtual space by moving an avatar of yourself.
                        When your avatar is near another person's avatar, their video and audio will connect with yours and you'll be able to chat with them.
                        When your avatars move apart, your video and audio will disconnect.
                        This makes it easy for multiple groups of people to hold separate conversations at the same time
                        without the hassle of breakout rooms. In a sense, it recreates in-person interactions!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll be giving a full tutorial and demo of Gather at our first meeting, so don't stress about it!
                        We think you'll like it much better than Zoom.
                    </p>
                    <h4>5. Attendance</h4>
                    <p>
                        With 18 MSU student-mentors and over 75 participants registered for the Spring 2021 session of SGWC,
                        we're on track for a record-breaking year! Help us keep it that way by striving to attend
                        at least 8 of our 10 meetings between 1/23 and 3/27. The more meetings you attend,
                        the more fun you'll have!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had to close registration in early January and turn a number of participants away in order to
                        keep our participant-to-mentor ratio from growing too large, so remember that your spot is valuable!
                    </p>
                    <h4>6. Participant Handbook</h4>
                    <p>
                        MSU Youth Program Policy requires us to distribute a
                        document detailing proper conduct of MSU student-mentors, faculty, staff and participants.
                        We don't expect to run into any issues this spring, but encourage you to review our
                        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yAM6ZSTKRrQ3XzymoPvGVNGdXqgTy6BF/view?usp=sharing">2021 SGWC Participant Handbook</a>
                        to make sure you do your part in making our program a success.
                    </p>
                    <h4>7. What to Expect</h4>
                    <p>
                        To keep group sizes manageable, we'll be breaking up into cohorts of approximately 25 participants
                        and 6 MSU student-mentors. We'll then work in groups of 2-4 participants
                        within our cohorts throughout the meeting to facilitate collaboration.
                        Cohort assignments will be given at the start of our first meeting on 1/23.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the course of SGWC, we'll be working through Khan Academy's
                        <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">
                            "Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation"
                        </a>
                        course, learning the basics of computer science by programming visualizations. That's right:
                        we'll be teaching computers how to draw! This curriculum is different from past years of SGWC,
                        so new and returning participants alike will be starting fresh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meetings typically begin with a 15-minute icebreaker, followed by a 15-minute spotlight
                        in which we showcase a different way computer science is used in the real world each week.
                        We'll then cover a set of slides introducing a new programming concept each week for 15 minutes
                        or so before breaking into small groups and working through coding exercises together for
                        about an hour. In the final 15 minutes, we'll reconvene for a reflection session and post-meeting survey!
                    </p>
                    <h4>8. Schedule</h4>
                    <p>
                        Meetings will be held every <b>Saturday from 10a-12p ET beginning January 23rd, 2021
                        and ending March 27th, 2021</b>.

                        In alignment with the guidance of Michigan public health officials, SGWC will be
                        offered Saturday mornings from 10a-12p via Zoom in a fully-remote format, beginning 1/23 and
                        ending 3/27.

                        Founded in 2018, Spartan Girls Who Code is an MSU student-led coding club introducing
                        6-12th grade students to the wide world of computer science.
                        Combining lessons in web development using HTML and CSS with guest speakers and social activities,
                        SGWC is more than just another extracurricular—it's a community.
                        We believe coding should be <i>fun</i>, and we aim to make it so!
