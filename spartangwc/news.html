                    The Michigan State University community experienced a tragic violent assault on February 13, 2023. In response, MSU cancelled all classes from the time of the assault until Monday February 20. Over this time, our Spartan Girls Who Code team has been working to navigate the aftermath of this event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for your patience and understanding as this healing process is ongoing. We are doing our best to provide valuable coding lessons to club participants while also  
                    accommodating needs of MSU student employees.
                </p>
                <p> We will inform all participants of any future schedule changes due to this event through both     email and this News page.
                    We strive to post notices of any changes as timely as possible, but at least by Saturday 8 a.m. for changes to a Saturday morning session and by Thursday noon for changes to a Thursday Bonus Hour.

                    <h4>2. Looking Ahead</h4>
                    <p>
                        We'll see you again this <b>Saturday, 2/11 at 10a ET</b> for our fourth SGWC meeting of the spring, where we will review material from last week and learn about copyright!

                    <h4>3. Questions?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As always, please reach out with any questions / concerns / ideas / feedback to <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.

                </ul>
                <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
                <p>
                    The day started off with a speed friending session with fellow coders. The coders were encouraged to get to know one another by answering prompts such as "What topic would you like to give a talk on?" and "If you were a candy bar, what kind would you be?". We heard some great responses!
                </p>
                <p>
                    After our icebreaker, we had two spotlight videos on UX writing to give the students an insight into careers related to what they are learning.
                </p>

                            <p><i>UX Writing in 60 seconds!</i></p>
                        </div>

                <p>
                    Once finished, we reviewed what we have learned from the previous weeks including formatting text, links, and attributes. We jumped into our lesson on images and learned about the image tag and its attributes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ended things with small mentor-student group discussions, reflecting on what went well, what was challenging, and what students are looking forward to at next Saturday's session. We make sure to listen to the students feedback, but don't hesitate to reach out to <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a> if you have any questions or concerns!

                    and we thought it would be fun to
                    introduce a few of our <a href="contact.html#team">team members</a> each week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To continue our mentor spotlight series, we'd like to introduce the Spring 2023 In-Person Lead Mentors!

                                <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                I took CSE 231 when I used to be a mechanical engineering major. I changed my major since then and no longer needed the class but I’m so glad I took it! I picked up coding pretty quickly and really enjoyed it.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                I made a digital art projection using JavaScript.

                            <p>
                                <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                                I hope to using coding as a supplemental part of my career.

                                Be gentle with yourself, not because you are fragile but because you are precious.

                    <h4>2. Girls Who Code Summer Programs</h4>
                    <p>
                        The national organization of Girls Who Code is offering two summer opportunities for high school students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Summer Immersion Program (SIP)</b> is a live, virtual, 2-week introduction to computer science course for 9th-11th graders. Students will learn 
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while getting an inside look into the tech industry through company sponsors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Self-Paced Program</b> is a <b>free</b> remote computer science course for 9th-12th graders who prefer not to adhere 
                        to a strict schedule. Participants can choose to earn beginner-level badges in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                        (for web development) or an intermediate-level badge in Python (for cybersecurity). Students will also have the chance to 
                        build a community through weekly sessions and Girls Who Code activities.
                    </p>

                        We'll see you again this <b>Saturday, 2/4 at 10a ET</b> for our third SGWC meeting of the spring, where we will review material from last week
                        and learn about images + copyright!
                    </p>
                    <h4>4. Questions?</h4>
                    <p>
                        As always, please reach out with any questions / concerns / ideas / feedback to <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.

                <p>
                    To start off the day, our in-person cohort divided into groups and discussed five things we all have in common with one another, and our virtual cohorts worked to navigate and complete an escape room together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After our icebreaker, we watched two videos for our spotlight about the intersection between fashion, art, and code!

                    Once finished, we jumped right into out lesson on HTML formatting and links, and we continued working on exercises in CodeHS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We ended things with small mentor-student group discussions, reflecting on what went well, what was challenging, and what students are looking forward to at next Saturday's session.

                <p>
                    SGWC is led, organized, and run by MSU students with the help of <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/iselava1">Teresa Isela Vandersloot</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/ldillon">Dr. Laura Dillon </a>,
                    and we thought it would be fun to
                    introduce a few of our <a href="contact.html#team">team members</a> each week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To continue our mentor spotlight series, we'd like to introduce the Spring 2023 Curriculum Leads! 
                    They have been working hard to plan the curriculum and adapting it to the coders' needs.

                    We kicked off the Spring 2023 version of Spartan Girls Who Code on Saturday with enthusiastic students
                    and incredible mentors &mdash; we hope your student is just as excited as we are for the coming weeks!
                </p>
                <p>
                    We as a club are so excited to introduce the world of coding to your student! Computer science and programming
                    is all around us in everything we do, and it is so much fun to learn! During this course, we want all students
                    to remember that they are learning something new, it might be challenging at times. But! &mdash; learning
                    to overcome those challenges and how to have fun with it is just as important as learning the material. We
                    hope your student keeps this in mind as we continue throughout the program.

                    <p>
                        The national organization of Girls Who Code is offering two summer opportunities for high school students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Summer Immersion Program (SIP)</b> is a live, virtual, 2-week introduction to computer science course for 9th-11th graders. Students will learn 
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while getting an inside look into the tech industry through company sponsors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Self-Paced Program</b> is a <b>free</b> remote computer science course for 9th-12th graders who prefer not to adhere 
                        to a strict schedule. Participants can choose to earn beginner-level badges in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
                        (for web development) or an intermediate-level badge in Python (for cybersecurity). Students will also have the chance to 
                        build a community through weekly sessions and Girls Who Code activities.

                    they cared about as a way to get to know a bit about one another. Engagement was high, and all enjoyed learning 
                    cool information about their peers!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the icebreaker, participants completed a program pre-survey which will help us
                    evaluate and improve SGWC in future years.
                    We've learned a lot from pre- and post-surveys in past years&mdash;we truly
                    appreciate our participants' thoughtful feedback! If your student did not complete the
                    pre-survey, please encourage them to do so at the link that applies to them: 
                    <a href="https://forms.gle/C8PATbXv1fGWjPUv9">In-person form</a>, 
                    <a href="https://forms.gle/C8PATbXv1fGWjPUv9">Virtual form</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, each cohort collaborated to write a club contract setting goals and expectations for
                    future meetings, and set up CodeHS accounts for use in the coming weeks.
                    We'll be working through the <a href="https://codehs.com/course/web_design_matisse/overview">
                        "Web Design (Matisse)"
                    </a>
                    course offered by CodeHS!
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    Finally, we encouraged participants to fill out an end-of-meeting survey to gauge
                    comfort with material covered in the meeting, and received overwhelmingly positive responses!
                    It's always scary to try something new, so we were glad to hear students that the students got off to a good start.
                    That said, we want to make sure <i>everyone</i> has a great time at SGWC this spring&mdash;so

                <p>
                    SGWC is led, organized, and run by MSU students with the help of <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/iselava1">Teresa Isela Vandersloot</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/ldillon">Dr. Laura Dillon </a>,
                    and we thought it would be fun to
                    introduce a few of our <a href="contact.html#team">team members</a> each week.
                </p>

                    <p>
                        Let's face it: we're all tired of Zoom these days.
                        So, we'll be using a new platform for the Spring 2021 session of SGWC:
                        <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather</a>.
                        We think it will make for a great online learning experience!
                        You can find more information in Gather's
                        <a href="https://gather.town/docs">documentation</a>, but we provide a brief summary below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gather is built around the idea of virtual proximity:
                        you can move into and out of conversations in a virtual space by moving an avatar of yourself.
                        When your avatar is near another person's avatar, their video and audio will connect with yours and you'll be able to chat with them.
                        When your avatars move apart, your video and audio will disconnect.
                        This makes it easy for multiple groups of people to hold separate conversations at the same time
                        without the hassle of breakout rooms. In a sense, it recreates in-person interactions!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll be giving a full tutorial and demo of Gather at our first meeting, so don't stress about it!
                        We think you'll like it much better than Zoom.
                    </p>
                    <h4>5. Attendance</h4>
                    <p>
                        With 18 MSU student-mentors and over 75 participants registered for the Spring 2021 session of SGWC,
                        we're on track for a record-breaking year! Help us keep it that way by striving to attend
                        at least 8 of our 10 meetings between 1/23 and 3/27. The more meetings you attend,
                        the more fun you'll have!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had to close registration in early January and turn a number of participants away in order to
                        keep our participant-to-mentor ratio from growing too large, so remember that your spot is valuable!
                    </p>
                    <h4>6. Participant Handbook</h4>
                    <p>
                        MSU Youth Program Policy requires us to distribute a
                        document detailing proper conduct of MSU student-mentors, faculty, staff and participants.
                        We don't expect to run into any issues this spring, but encourage you to review our
                        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yAM6ZSTKRrQ3XzymoPvGVNGdXqgTy6BF/view?usp=sharing">2021 SGWC Participant Handbook</a>
                        to make sure you do your part in making our program a success.
                    </p>
                    <h4>7. What to Expect</h4>
                    <p>
                        To keep group sizes manageable, we'll be breaking up into cohorts of approximately 25 participants
                        and 6 MSU student-mentors. We'll then work in groups of 2-4 participants
                        within our cohorts throughout the meeting to facilitate collaboration.
                        Cohort assignments will be given at the start of our first meeting on 1/23.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the course of SGWC, we'll be working through Khan Academy's
                        <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">
                            "Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation"

                        course, learning the basics of computer science by programming visualizations. That's right:
                        we'll be teaching computers how to draw! This curriculum is different from past years of SGWC,
                        so new and returning participants alike will be starting fresh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meetings typically begin with a 15-minute icebreaker, followed by a 15-minute spotlight
                        in which we showcase a different way computer science is used in the real world each week.
                        We'll then cover a set of slides introducing a new programming concept each week for 15 minutes
                        or so before breaking into small groups and working through coding exercises together for
                        about an hour. In the final 15 minutes, we'll reconvene for a reflection session and post-meeting survey!

                        Founded in 2018, Spartan Girls Who Code is an MSU student-led coding club introducing
                        6-12th grade students to the wide world of computer science.
                        Combining lessons in web development using HTML and CSS with guest speakers and social activities,
                        SGWC is more than just another extracurricular &mdash; it's a community.
                        We believe coding should be <i>fun</i>, and we aim to make it so!
