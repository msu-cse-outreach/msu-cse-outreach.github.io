                    We were so excited to see all of your students’ enthusiasm as we wrapped up Week 4 of our 
                    Spring 2022 Spartan Girls Who Code Program! This week, we learned about copyright and how to format 
                    and insert images on our webpages!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before we dive into a full recap of Saturday's meeting, we'd like to share a few announcements.

                    <h4>2. Feedback</h4>
                    <p>
                        Us mentors are paying attention! This past week, we have left feedback for each one of our students. 
                        If you would like to see it, you can find that in CodeHS under one of your assignments! 
                        The assignment button will be colored pink or dark blue. 
                    </p>
                    <h4>3. Girls Who Code Summer Programs</h4>
                    <p>
                        The national organization of Girls Who Code is offering <b>free</b>, virtual summer opportunities for high school students from
                        <b>June 17 - August 12</b>, and the application is <a href="https://girlswhocodesm.smapply.io/?utm_source=Domestic+Campaign+Monitor&utm_medium=Campaign+Monitor&utm_campaign=Campaign+Monitor+2022">OPEN.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Summer Immersion Program (SIP)</b> is a live, virtual, 2-week intro computer science course for 9th-11th graders. You will learn
                        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while getting an inside look into the tech industry through company sponsors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>Self-Paced Program</b> is a flexible computer science course for 9th-12th graders who prefer not to adhere to a strict schedule.
                        Participants can choose to earn beginner-level badges in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development) or an intermediate-level badge in
                        Python (for cybersecurity). Students will also have the chance to build a community through weekly sessions and Girls Who Code activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are interested, the application linked above only takes about 15-20 minutes to complete, and doesn't require GPA, transcripts,
                        or recommendations!
                    </p>
                    <h4>4. Looking Ahead</h4>
                    <p>
                        We'll see you again this Saturday, 2/19 at 10a ET for our fifth SGWC meeting of the spring, where we will be learning about lists and tables in HTML!
                    </p>
                    <h4>5. Questions?</h4>

                <p>
                    To start off this week, we did an icebreaker where students drew their favorite activities, animals, and more!
                    We got to see some awesome sketches and heard about some really fun hobbies!

                <p>
                    After our ice breaker, we went directly to our spotlight, where our students learned how biases in algorithms can affect others. 
                    TED Talk speaker Joy Buolamwini explained how she has been working to combat this issue.

                    where they learned many different ways to format images and how to insert on their websites. They also learned the importance of copyright 
                    protection and how to select images that were marked for reuse. A few of our students' creations are shown below.

                <p>
                    To start off this week, we did an icebreaker where students shared their favorite part of their week – we heard that a 
                    lot of students had snow days over the snowstorm during the later part of the week.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After our ice breaker, we went directly to our spotlight, where our students saw a preview of two different careers 
                    in the world of computer science. Interviews with Brina, a software engineer and Polina, a data scientist, that 
                    explored how they were introduced to the world of computer science and what they do at their current job today.

                    Once our students finished sharing their thoughts on some different computer science careers, we jumped right into a quick

                        <h4>2. Girls Who Code Summer Programs</h4>
                        <p>
                            The national organization of Girls Who Code is offering <b>free</b>, virtual summer opportunities for high school students from
                            <b>June 17 - August 12</b>, and the application is <a href="https://girlswhocodesm.smapply.io/?utm_source=Domestic+Campaign+Monitor&utm_medium=Campaign+Monitor&utm_campaign=Campaign+Monitor+2022">OPEN.</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <b>Summer Immersion Program (SIP)</b> is a live, virtual, 2-week intro computer science course for 9th-11th graders. You will learn
                            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while getting an inside look into the tech industry through company sponsors.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                    <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
                    <p>
                        To start off this week, we did a fun “Show and Tell” icebreaker, where students shared some of their favorite keepsakes – we
                         saw some awesome instruments, books, collections, and even met some adorable pets! Ask your student what they shared!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After our ice breaker, we went directly to our spotlight, where our students saw a preview of all that's possible in the 
                        wide world of computer science through this week's spotlight video. Interviews with Bill Gates, Will. I. Am., Mark Zuckerberg, 
                        and others underscored the importance of learning to code in the year 2022!

                    <p>
                        Once our students finished sharing their amazing ideas for some future coding projects,
                         we jumped right into a quick <b>Kahoot!</b> review of last week’s content!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After that, we continued with the HTML lessons that our students started last week on 
                        <a href="https://codehs.com">CodeHS</a> where they learned many different ways to format text and how to 
                         insert on their websites. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We ended things with small mentor-student group discussions, reflecting on what went well, what was challenging, 
                        and what students are looking forward to at next Saturday's session. 
                        Responses to our weekly feedback survey were again quite positive, but don't hesitate to reach out 
                        to info@spartangwc.org if you have any questions or concerns!

                        We kicked off the Spring 2022 version of Spartan Girls Who Code on Saturday with enthusiastic students
                        and incredible mentors &mdash; we hope your student is just as excited as we are for the coming weeks!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We as a club are so excited to introduce the world of coding to your student! Computer science and programming
                        is all around us in everything we do, and it is so much fun to learn! During this course, we want all students
                        to remember that they are learning something new, it might be challenging at times. But! &mdash; learning
                        to overcome those challenges and how to have fun with it is just as important as learning the material. We
                        hope your student keeps this in mind as we continue throughout the program.

                        <h4>3. Girls Who Code Summer Programs</h4>
                        <p>
                            The national organization of Girls Who Code is offering <b>free</b>, virtual summer opportunities for high school students from
                            <b>June 17 - August 12</b>, and the application is <a href="https://girlswhocodesm.smapply.io/?utm_source=Domestic+Campaign+Monitor&utm_medium=Campaign+Monitor&utm_campaign=Campaign+Monitor+2022">OPEN.</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <b>Summer Immersion Program (SIP)</b> is a live, virtual, 2-week intro computer science course for 9th-11th graders. You will learn
                            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while getting an inside look into the tech industry through company sponsors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <b>Self-Paced Program</b> is a flexible computer science course for 9th-12th graders who prefer not to adhere to a strict schedule.
                            Participants can choose to earn beginner-level badges in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development) or an intermediate-level badge in
                            Python (for cybersecurity). Students will also have the chance to build a community through weekly sessions and Girls Who Code activities.
                        </p>

                            We'll see you again this <b>Saturday, 1/29 at 10a ET</b> for our second SGWC meeting of the spring, where we will review last weeks material
                            and begin learning about text + links in webpages!
                        </p>
                        <h4>5. Questions?</h4>

                    <p>
                        Mentors welcomed participants in their Cohort Zoom rooms, and as students rolled in
                        mentor-student bonding had already begun! As much as we miss seeing everyone in person
                        at the Engineering Building on MSU's campus, we loved seeing some students turn their
                        cameras on and start engaging with the mentors! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To kick things off, each cohort participated in an Icebreaker via Google Jamboard &mdash; a collaborative and digital
                        whiteboard where students can share their answers on virtual sticky notes. We used it as an opportunity begin getting to
                        know the students and the mentors by having questions and would-you-rather statements to answer as a group! We
                        got great student engagement and found out some cool information about our cohorts.

                    <p>
                        Following the icebreaker, participants completed a program pre-survey which will help us
                        evaluate and improve SGWC in future years.
                        We've learned a lot from pre- and post-surveys in past years&mdash;we truly
                        appreciate our participants' thoughtful feedback! If your student did not complete the
                        pre-survey, please encourage them to do so <a href="https://forms.gle/8hQACmkWRHjBUrCK6">at this link</a>.

                    <p>
                        Next, each cohort collaborated to write a club contract setting goals and expectations for
                        future meetings, and set up CodeHS accounts for use in the coming weeks.
                        We'll be working through the <a href="https://codehs.com/course/web_design_matisse/overview">

                        comfort with Zoom and CodeHS, and received overwhelmingly positive responses!
                        It's always scary to try something new, so we were glad to hear students that the students got off to a good start.
                        That said, we want to make sure <i>everyone</i> has a great time at SGWC this spring&mdash;so

                        SGWC is led, organized, and run by MSU students with the help of <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/iselava1">Teresa Isela Vandersloot</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/ldillon">Dr. Laura Dillon</a> and <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/wulfekuh">Dr. Marilyn Wulfekulher</a>,
                        and we thought it would be fun to
                        introduce a few of our <a href="contact.html#team">team members</a> each week.

                                    I am a fourth year majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Spanish!
                                </p>

                                    <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                                    I took Java as an elective my sophomore year in high school and found it very challenging but fun!
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    You don’t always have to be good at your hobbies as long as you love doing them — keep at it and you will get better!

                    <p>
                        Let's face it: we're all tired of Zoom these days.
                        So, we'll be using a new platform for the Spring 2021 session of SGWC:
                        <a href="https://gather.town/">Gather</a>.
                        We think it will make for a great online learning experience!
                        You can find more information in Gather's
                        <a href="https://gather.town/docs">documentation</a>, but we provide a brief summary below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gather is built around the idea of virtual proximity:
                        you can move into and out of conversations in a virtual space by moving an avatar of yourself.
                        When your avatar is near another person's avatar, their video and audio will connect with yours and you'll be able to chat with them.
                        When your avatars move apart, your video and audio will disconnect.
                        This makes it easy for multiple groups of people to hold separate conversations at the same time
                        without the hassle of breakout rooms. In a sense, it recreates in-person interactions!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We'll be giving a full tutorial and demo of Gather at our first meeting, so don't stress about it!
                        We think you'll like it much better than Zoom.
                    </p>
                    <h4>5. Attendance</h4>
                    <p>
                        With 18 MSU student-mentors and over 75 participants registered for the Spring 2021 session of SGWC,
                        we're on track for a record-breaking year! Help us keep it that way by striving to attend
                        at least 8 of our 10 meetings between 1/23 and 3/27. The more meetings you attend,
                        the more fun you'll have!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We had to close registration in early January and turn a number of participants away in order to
                        keep our participant-to-mentor ratio from growing too large, so remember that your spot is valuable!
                    </p>
                    <h4>6. Participant Handbook</h4>
                    <p>
                        MSU Youth Program Policy requires us to distribute a
                        document detailing proper conduct of MSU student-mentors, faculty, staff and participants.
                        We don't expect to run into any issues this spring, but encourage you to review our
                        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yAM6ZSTKRrQ3XzymoPvGVNGdXqgTy6BF/view?usp=sharing">2021 SGWC Participant Handbook</a>
                        to make sure you do your part in making our program a success.
                    </p>
                    <h4>7. What to Expect</h4>
                    <p>
                        To keep group sizes manageable, we'll be breaking up into cohorts of approximately 25 participants
                        and 6 MSU student-mentors. We'll then work in groups of 2-4 participants
                        within our cohorts throughout the meeting to facilitate collaboration.
                        Cohort assignments will be given at the start of our first meeting on 1/23.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the course of SGWC, we'll be working through Khan Academy's
                        <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">
                            "Intro to JavaScript: Drawing and Animation"
                        </a>
                        course, learning the basics of computer science by programming visualizations. That's right:
                        we'll be teaching computers how to draw! This curriculum is different from past years of SGWC,
                        so new and returning participants alike will be starting fresh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Meetings typically begin with a 15-minute icebreaker, followed by a 15-minute spotlight
                        in which we showcase a different way computer science is used in the real world each week.
                        We'll then cover a set of slides introducing a new programming concept each week for 15 minutes
                        or so before breaking into small groups and working through coding exercises together for
                        about an hour. In the final 15 minutes, we'll reconvene for a reflection session and post-meeting survey!
                    </p>
                    <h4>8. Schedule</h4>
                    <p>
                        Meetings will be held every <b>Saturday from 10a-12p ET beginning January 23rd, 2021
                        and ending March 27th, 2021</b>.
                        If your student is no longer planning to participate in the Spring 2021 session of SGWC, please send us an email at

                        Combining lessons in web development using HTML and CSS with guest speakers and social activities,
