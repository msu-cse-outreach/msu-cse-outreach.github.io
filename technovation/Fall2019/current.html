                        <p>
                            Without the enthusiasm of our coders, the encouragement of their parents, the passion of our MSU mentors, and the generosity of our
                            facilitators, the fall 2019 installment of Technovation would not have been possible &minus; if you're reading this, you are the reason our program
                            was a success. Thank you again!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As promised, photos from last fall's installment of Technovation can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZPDPgfNrr7hRK86aw5w9fQblGD_ZjpjB?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>. Additionally, we'd appreciate if you could fill out our <a href="https://forms.gle/KYm7R4tmvAoxVRcA7" target="_blank">parent post-survey</a> so we can take your suggestions to heart when planning Technovation next year. We value your feedback!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Looking for another in-person program similar to Technovation? The Grand Ledge Area District Library is offering a brand-new
                            "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/647905729283876/" target="_blank">Code Club!</a>" on Wednesday evenings from 6-7pm beginning January 15th. This program is open to students aged 8-18, requires no prior coding knowledge, and will guide them to create 
                            "websites, video games, apps, animations, and more." Students will even have the opportunity to earn Boy Scout, Cub Scout, and
                            Girl Scout merit badges through their participation!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If your coder is hoping to extend their adventure through computing in the new year, we encourage them check out the various

                            Saturday's Technovation Showcase marked only the end of the beginning for our students &minus; their final projects were clear evidence of
                            the bright futures awaiting each of them. It's been a pleasure seeing their growth as problem-solvers, communicators, teammmates, leaders,
                            partners, and thinkers over the course of the past nine weeks &minus; their energy and enthusiasm have made Technovation 2019 an absolute
                            joy.

                            Coding is <i>hard</i> &minus; if it were easy, everybody would do it. Just as 
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYzN0a1U8mI">Steph Curry</a> and 
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZyqeiAtlA">Draymond Green</a> 
                            have to work hard and practice
                            to play at the top of the NBA, computer scientists have to bring their A-game every day to push through complexity, think creatively,
                            and learn constantly to keep improving. Our students lived up to this challenge week in and week out, and the results speak for
                            themselves. We couldn't be more proud of their work!

                            From the students who arrived curious and open-minded each week to the parents who entrusted their children to the
                            program, we thank you.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            From Dr. Laura Dillon to Teresa Isela Vandersloot to Chris Breznau and all of the Michigan State faculty who contributed their time and experience
                            to help make Technovation a success, we thank you.
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally, to the student mentors who combined their passion for computing with their desire to give back and spent their Saturday mornings
                            working with aspiring computer scientists week in and week out, we thank you. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The whole of Technovation is greater than the sum of its parts, and we look forward to seeing the lasting impact it leaves on students, parents,
                            mentors, and facilitators alike.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Until next year, we wish you all the best.

                        <h4>The final countdown</h4>

                        <p>
                            Saturday's mood was bittersweet for students and mentors alike &minus; while it marked the final class of the 2019 session of Technovation,
                            it also showed how far each and every one of our programmers have come over the past 8 weeks. Continuing to work in teams,
                            students wrapped up their final projects, making use of all the commands and problem-solving strategies they've learned this fall.
                            With only high-level guidance from mentors, students made use of functions, loops, and user input to write efficient, modular, and flexible
                            code, yielding beautiful drawings as output!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once each team reached a satisfactory stopping point, groups took turns presenting their work to the rest of the class, building their confidence
                            and public speaking skills before next week's Technovation Showcase. We can't wait for them to show off what they've put together &minus; be prepared
                            to be impressed!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you missed last week's update, we'd like to remind you that
                            <strong>all families of students are invited to attend the Technovation Showcase on Saturday, 11/23, from 10am to 12pm</strong> 
                            where students will be presenting their final projects and explaining the challenges they overcame while creating them. Following presentations 
                            and a few remarks from
                            the Technovation team, we'll celebrate the conclusion of this year's program with a pizza luncheon.

                            In addition to finalizing and presenting projects, students filled out a post-survey evaluating their experience at Technovation this fall;
                            if your student was absent this week, we encourage them to fill out the student survey 
                            <a href="https://forms.gle/YtbZEF1ob3borCEj8">here</a>. Their feedback is extremely valuable
                            as we continue to improve subsequent offerings of Technovation.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By the same token, we value your feedback as a parent &minus; we'd love to hear your thoughts regarding this year's 
                            session of Technovation through our parent survey

                        <p>
                            With the end of our Fall 2019 session of Technovation in sight, students brought their imagination to life in an incredibly
                            wide variety of final projects! From rainbow cookies to a rainbow flower, pixelated cartoon characters to a city skyline, a basketball
                            court to a famous statue, and animated text-art to an interactive, user-customizeable Etch-A-Sketch-like canvas, students poured their
                            hearts into their work this week. It's amazing how fast time flies when the group is having fun &minus; it felt as though our two hours together
                            passed in the blink of an eye!

                            Next week, students will continue to collaborate on their final projects, applying all
                            they've learned over the course of Technovation to create with code. Given all they were able to accomplish during this week's
                            session, we can't wait to see what they add next week to show off at the Technovation Showcase!

                        <p>
                            As always, we encourage students to try a handful of the challenge activities posted on <a href="https://codehs.com/">CodeHS</a>;
                            they should be able to access their account and all associated Technovation materials from any internet-connected computer. No new
                            exercises have been posted this week; however, unfinished exercises from weeks past are a great resource to review the fundamentals students
                            will need to apply as they create their final projects. For reference,
                            a Tracy command cheat-sheet can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EbU3Kmk9_pCQN33LRmSD2pjY5Cds3AcV/view?usp=sharing">here.</a>

                            Week 6 featured no tricks, but plenty of treats &minus; students brought their A-game yet again to conquer a series of review challenges
                            emphasizing the use of variables, user input, functions, loops, and artistic effects to draw complex images more efficiently. Thursday's
                            hunt for candy must've been a success, as the group energy level was high!

                        <p>
                            Students put their new programming knowledge to work in order to draw a stack of pancakes to a variable
                            height specified by the user, draw a set of balloons of variable size and color specified by the user, and
                            draw a set of books of variable number, height, width, spacing, and color specified by the user. To appreciate the power and flexibility of these

                        <p>
                            For this week's spotlight, students heard from MSU alumnus and current Golden State Warriors player
                            Draymond Green. Draymond reminded us all that
                        </p>                          

                        <blockquote>
                            "... hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard"
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>
                            both on the court and in the classroom &minus; when it comes to programming, dedication and deliberate practice is essential, just
                            as in basketball. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJZyqeiAtlA">Hear the rest of what Draymond has to say below!</a>

                        <p>
                            Next, students formed teams to brainstorm final projects to create and present at the Technovation
                            Showcase, thinking outside of the box for ways to combine loops, functions, variables, and user input
                            to make a masterpiece of their own design. Mentors created their own
                            example final projects and shared the details of how they went about programming them to get students thinking
                            about how they might break down their problem and chunk it piece by piece &minus; as a result, students left with a solid plan
                            of attack to start on next week!

                        <p>
                            This week, students took their programming skills to a whole new level, incorporating user input and variables to customize their creations
                            and generate tailor-made drawings fresh on-demand!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Before diving into this week's lesson, students heard from <a href="https://youtu.be/lENoMZZ4mpU">Robin Hunicke</a>, 
                            a video game designer who uses code every day to create the
                            graphics, synchronize the music, and orchestrate the storylines behind the video games she creates. Robin's story goes to show how
                            a career in computer science is not just for mathematically-minded, logic-loving, or function-focused problem solvers, but for creative 
                            innovators, too &minus; as Robin herself puts it,
                        </p>
                            
                            <blockquote>
                                ...the great thing about making a video game is that it encompasses just about every creative activity that you can imagine!
                            </blockquote>

                        <p>
                            After watching this week's spotlight featuring Robin and discusssing how they hope to get "creative with code" some day, students
                            learned about <i>variables</i> and <i>user input</i> in Python before jumping into a hands-on walkthrough in which they applied
                            these concepts.
                        </p> 

                        <p>
                            <i>Variables</i> are named locations in the memory of a computer which store a value, and <i>user input</i> 
                            can be leveraged to set the values stored in variables &minus; as an analogy, variables can be thought of as "cubbies" within a computer
                            which store a number or string of text, while user input can be thought of as one way to store particular numbers or strings of text
                            within each cubby. Together, variables and user input enable flexibility in a program, as specific numbers or strings of text may be
                            replaced by a variable whose stored value may <i>vary</i> over the course of a program's execution.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Armed with their newfound knowledge, students worked to programmatically draw
                            a set of ice cream cones whose scoop and cone colors could be customized using variables and user input in an incredibly
                            successful walkthrough &minus; as always, we were blown away by the creativity and imagination of our students!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Working incrementally, they first used functions to draw a "single scoop," then
                            extended their programs using a loop to draw "triple scoop" before integrating variables and user input to customize the colors of the
                            scoops of those "triple scoops." Finally, they used a loop to draw 5 identical ice cream cones &minus; because more is better when it comes
                            to ice cream!
                        </p>

                        <h4>Fortifying the foundation</h4>

                        <p>
                            Students took this week to slow down and solidify their foundations
                            by working through two mentor-led code-alongs emphasizing the fundamentals of loops and functions. As always, we were impressed by the 
                            diversity, creativity, and novelty of programs students produced!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After a quick warmup activity to get things started, students heard from Steph Curry who discussed the importance of learning computer science
                            in this week's <a href="https://youtu.be/NYzN0a1U8mI">spotlight</a>, linked below. Steph noted that careers in technology are "in high demand" and encouraged students to
                            persevere through the challenge of learning to code because "anything that's worth doing usually doesn't come easily." Just as Steph has to
                            practice to be one of the best basketball players in the NBA, it takes practice to hone one's programming skills!

                        <p>
                            Following this inspiring spotlight, <a href="contact.html#team">Hannah</a> led students through a code-along which reviewed functions, loops, and various artistic effects
                            by creating a function to teach Tracy how to draw a shaded square with a single command &minus; students then used this function to create 
                            tiles all across their canvas just as an abstract artist might!
                        </p> 

                        <p>
                            Next, <a href="contact.html#team">Zosha</a> led students through the complex challenge of teaching Tracy to draw a flower by breaking
                            the problem down into a sequence of simpler steps. First, students taught Tracy to draw a single petal; then, students
                            used a loop to draw multiple petals. Next, students taught Tracy to draw a stem; finally, students instructed Tracy to fill the center
                            of the flower as a finishing touch. The resulting creations were quite intricate!

                            Although students didn't learn any new commands this week, we provided them with a "cheat sheet" to recap all they've learned

                        <h4>Getting func-y with it</h4><p></p>

                        <p>
                            This week, students learned to simplify their code by defining and calling <i>functions</i> &minus; as a result, they were able to create 
                            impressively complex programs with only a few lines of code!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            What's a <i>function</i>, exactly? Put simply, it's a programmer's shortcut, enabling one to execute multiple commands with a single line
                            of code. By defining a function, a programmer can create a <i>sub-routine</i> which completes a specific sub-task, then <i>call</i> that
                            function into service in order to complete a larger, more complex task. Just as loops help programmers eliminate repeated code, so do functions! 
                            Better yet, programmers can even combine loops with functions to save themselves a considerable amount of work!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Using functions, students were able to "teach" Tracy new commands, such as how to draw a <tt>square()</tt> or <tt>triangle()</tt>. In
                            addition, students learned how to add pizazz to their programs by configuring Tracy's artistic settings, such as her <tt>color()</tt> and
                            <tt>pensize()</tt>. Check out the following videos for a recap of all we covered this week!

                            Last but certainly not least, this week's <a href="https://youtu.be/xJqSu1IbcHg">spotlight video</a> highlighted the wide range of 
                            career possiblities within computer science and technology, from fashion to
                            agriculture, medicine to energy, and from art to entertainment. The only limit in computer science is one's imagination!

                            It's crazy to believe we're already through Week 3, but time flies when you're having fun! We look forward to welcoming students back
                            next week and watching them continue to grow as programmers, problem-solvers, and collaborators over the next six weeks.

                        <p>
                            Week 2 primarily focused on solidifiying the foundation constructed in Week 1; students learned to turn Tracy with the
                            <tt>left(number)</tt> and <tt>right(number)</tt> commands, control her speed with the <tt>speed(number)</tt> command, and move her from
                            point to point using the <tt>setposition(x, y)</tt> command.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Students also learned to simplify and remove redundancy from their code by using <tt>for</tt> loops, which designate a certain
                            number of commands to be repeated more than one time. Efficiency is a goal every programmer strives for, and writing loops in place
                            of repeated commands enabled students to produce incredibly sophisticated drawings with only a few lines of code!

                        <p>Ready or not, we're off to the races!</p>

                        <p>
                            Today, we welcomed the fall 2019 class of Technovators to our program and introduced the basics of Python and Tracy the Turtle with 
                            <a href="https://codehs.com/">CodeHS,</a>
                            an online, interactive coding platform around which our curriculum is centered.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After a short "find someone who..." icebreaker to get things started, students filled out the 
                            <a href="https://forms.gle/RkJCsx4SshecnFpT9">Technovation Pre-Survey</a>  and configured their
                            CodeHS accounts, enrolling in the fall 2019 section of Technovation on the platform. 
                            Students then watched an inspiring Spotlight video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nKIu9yen5nc">("What Most Schools Don't Teach")</a>
                            courtesy of <a href="https://code.org">Code.org</a> and 
                            discussed how programming skills can be a "hidden superpower" in the 21st century before stepping back and thinking about what programming 
                            really <i>is</i>. 
                        </p>

                        <div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">

                        <p>
                            The conclusion? Programming is what one makes of it &minus; after all, <i>programming</i> is nothing more than giving a computer
                            a set of directions to perform a task! Whether one chooses to instruct a computer to create an animation, compute the solutions to 
                            an equation, play a game against a human, or display information on a webpage is up to the computer scientist herself; with programming, one
                            can accomplish anything she sets her mind to!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Finally, students dove into the basics of Python, a programming language which formalizes how a computer scientist can "talk" to 
                            a computer, and were introduced Tracy the Turtle, a module within Python which draws the output of a user's
                            program. Students watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=Mksb32MStZI">Introduction to Tracy</a> and
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=gazdkrncug8">Tracy's Grid World</a> to familiarize themselves with the 
                            fundamentals, then attempted a handful of challenge activities
                            to solidify their grasp on the material. Below is a review of the commands students learned at this week's class; the slides
                            from Saturday can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AWV7zIscFmut9uAu5KVDrwo9-OO43lHSHKJp1fJOPgg/edit?usp=sharing">here!</a>
