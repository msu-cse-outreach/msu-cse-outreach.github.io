                We've come a long way from Week 1: just six weeks ago, we could only guess what
                <i>loops, functions, variables</i> and <i>user input</i> were all about.
                In fact, we'd still be shaky on our definition of a computer program! We didn't yet fully
                understand the difference between <i>writing</i> code and <i>running</i> code&mdash;now, the distinction is obvious.
            </p>

            <p>
                That said, the journey is far more important than the final destination. Team Technovation
                has had a blast along the way, and we hope your students have, too. From our perspective,
                completing exercises and covering new content
                isn't nearly as important as having fun and cultivating curiosity&mdash;there's plenty of time
                to learn the technical details later on.
            </p>

            <p>
                It only takes a spark of passion to ignite a future in computing, and we hope we've provided that spark.

               To spark conversation at our final session, we opened with another set of (not-so) serious questions.

                Switching up our usual routine, we dove into code immediately after
                our icebreaker. Students reviewed all they've learned over the course of Technovation in breakout rooms
                and combined loops, functions, variables and user input to code their <i>own</i> creations at this week's
                session, moving beyond scripted exercises to realize their own vision.
                We especially loved Anisha and Haresh's drawings&mdash;thanks for sharing them with us!

                their personal story with computer science, including how they first decided to study
                computer science, what they enjoy about the field, what projects they've made with code, and what
                advice they have to students interested in pursuing a future in STEM.
                They also shared a number of resources students can use to continue their journey in
                computing&mdash;<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CkgREB3rKNwawM3g6tHi4OKDD6ocCTfCbifFPyzucJ0/edit?usp=sharing">check

               To end the Fall 2020 session on a high note, we played a friendly round of Technovation trivia
               on Kahoot, answering questions about Python, spotlights, mentors, and computer science in general.
               Our champions were Aadarshini, Nysha and Raquel, though the competition was intense&mdash;there

                with us through the first-ever virtual Technovation&mdash;your enthusiasm, energy,
                and smiles are the reason we love to do what we do. We've found
                joy in the community that Technovation has brought during these trying times, and with solace in the normalcy
                it has restored. Before we know it, we'll be back in person&mdash;but in the meantime, we're glad we

           <p>
               As usual, our (not-so) serious icebreaker questions spurred quite the conversation this week:
           </p>
            <ol>
                <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Would you rather have an elephant-sized hamster or a hamster-sized elephant?</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Would you rather be able to swim without needing to hold your breath or fly?</li>
            </ol>
           <p>
               An elephant-sized hamster sounds a bit terrifying, while a hamster-sized elephant sounds adorable&mdash;but
               we agreed that density matters! Does the weight of each scale with the size?
               Swimming without needing air and flying each bring a unique upside&mdash;in this case, we agreed
               speed matters! How fast can we swim or fly?
           </p>

           <p>
               While engaging in this debate, students found gifs, memes and other images to describe their
               experience with virtual learning. It's a struggle, but at least we can all laugh about it!
           </p>

                Our weekly spotlights aim to showcase all that's possible in the world of computer science,
                and typically spur discussion by way of a video feature or guest speaker. This week's spotlight
                was a bit different&mdash;rather than <i>hear</i> about what's possible with computer science,
                students had the opportunity to <i>see</i> what's possible themselves.
           </p>

                Students explored the broad array of demos, widgets and apps featured on the
                <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/">Experiments with Google</a> site, sharing their favorite links with the group
                and joining together to try out various multiplayer experiments.
                A few favorites included the
                <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/shared-piano">Shared Piano</a>, the
                <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/quick-draw">Quick, Draw!</a> experiment, the

                <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/draw-to-art-shape">Draw to Art</a> experiment.
                Ask your student to show you how each experiment works, and how computer science
                connects to art and music!

           <p>
                Motivated by these experiments to make our own art with code, we dove back into our exploration of Python Turtle
                in breakout rooms for the rest of the meeting. Some groups reviewed loops and functions, while others
                moved on to learn how to tie <i>user input</i>
                into their programs to create more sophisticated drawings.
           </p>

           <p>
                If you're reading this newsletter in an email client or web browser, you've used user input&mdash;the
                very action of typing a URL into a browser or clicking on an email to open it involves user input!
                Could you imagine if your computer didn't listen to you, and instead opened a random URL or email?
           </p>

           <p>
               In Python Turtle, we can leverage user input to specify colors, shapes, and sizes on-the-fly:
               for example, we might ask a user what their favorite color is, then save that information and draw
               a square in their favorite color. Ask your student how they could use user input to customize
               this week's drawings, shown below!

           <h4>Old Turtle, New Tricks</h4>

           <p>
                Given the right trainer, an old dog can certainly learn new tricks&mdash;but what about an old turtle?
           </p>

           <p>
                As our students discovered this week, an old turtle can learn new tricks as well&mdash;at least a
                Python Turtle can! <i>Functions</i> give us a way to teach these new tricks with code, ultimately making our
                programs simpler and allowing us to do more with less.

               If there's one thing 2020 has brought plenty of, it's big, important, heavy questions: there's been
               no shortage given the pandemic and election alone. As such, we figured we'd open Saturday's meeting
               with a handful of our own (not-so) important questions:
           </p>
            <ol>
                <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Would you rather have a pet alligator or a pet talking almond?</li>
                <li style="list-style-type: decimal;">Do you think you would last longer against a shark or a tiger?</li>
            </ol>
           <p>
               We had a blast discussing the group's take on each issue: on one hand, we agreed it would be a
               power move to have a pet alligator&mdash;but on the other hand, we agreed a pet talking almond would be
               the safer choice. Likewise, we agreed that context matters on the second question: a shark
               wouldn't be much of a challenge on land, while a tiger would be an easy win if we had a few steaks to feed it!
           </p>

           <p>
               Students then described their past week
               in gifs, memes and other images&mdash;everyone's exhausted from
               the routine of Zoom classes, screen time and shorter days.
               Laughing together, we found we're all in the same boat!

                This week's spotlight featured Hadas Bitran, a software engineer working at Microsoft to advance
                the frontiers of healthcare with technology. Connecting her work to her passion
                for health and wellbeing, Hadas showed us how a career in computer science can be about so much more
                than writing code&mdash;in her case, it's literally about saving lives! Since the start of the COVID-19
                pandemic, her team has deployed over 1,700 healthcare chatbots in 23 countries to guide patients
                through symptom checks and telemedicine visits.

           <p>
                Back to our earlier question: what do old turtles, new tricks, and code have to do with one another?
           </p>

           <p>
                The connection is actually quite straightforward: when writing the code which tells our
                Python Turtle how to draw a picture, we may teach our turtle new tricks using <i>functions</i>.
                For example, suppose we want our Python Turtle to draw a square&mdash;then, we could
                explicitly tell our turtle to draw a line and turn left 90 degrees four times over.
                But wouldn't it be more convenient if we could just create our own <code>square</code> command
                and tell the turtle to draw a square with that single command? In other words, wouldn't it be
                easier to teach the turtle to draw a square once, then refer back to that lesson by
                just commanding our turtle to draw a <code>square</code>?
           </p>

           <p>
                In fact, this is precisely what functions do! By <i>defining</i> a new
                command, they allow us to teach our turtle new tricks.
           </p>

                    Using functions, we can teach our Python Turtle all kinds of new tricks:
                    how to draw a <code>triangle</code>, how to draw a <code>tree</code>, and how to draw a <code>star</code>!

                new album? You put it on repeat, of course!
           </p>

           <p>
               Imagine for a second that Spotify and Apple Music <i>didn't</i> have a repeat button. It'd be
               incredibly annoying to have to press play <i>again, and again, and again</i> every time you
               wanted to hear your new jam&mdash;wouldn't it?
           </p>

           <p>
               Believe it or not, we often run into the same problem when writing code! The good news?
               Just as Spotify and Apple Music have a repeat button, programming languages have <i>loops</i>.

                We began our session in breakout rooms and worked in small groups
                through a number of review exercises&mdash;after all, practice makes perfect! Recalling the
                <code>forward, backward, left, right, circle, up, down, goto</code> and <code>color</code> commands
                we learned last week, students and mentors worked together to recreate some of the drawings below

                Next, we celebrated Halloween with a spooky edition of virtual bingo&mdash;students
                had a blast checking off their favorite Halloween movie and video game characters
                in a fierce race to four-in-a-row! Bingo may be a game of pure chance, but that
                didn't stop the celebrations and smiles that came with a win. If you'd like to play
                a round with your family, friends, or classmates, you can access our bingo

                In this week's spotlight,
                we heard from Zach Lieberman, a pioneer in the space of computational art&mdash;Zach's work
                ties drawing, singing and color science together with technology to create one-of-a-kind
                pieces unlike anything our students or mentors had seen before. From an app that
                imitates the sketching process of a human to a pitch-visualizer and custom-built
                LED light show, Zach exemplifies the fact that computer science can be combined with just about
                any of one's passions to make a mark.
           </p>

           <p>
               If you're curious to hear Zach's story, check out the video we showed below.
               Ask your student what they thought about it!

           <p>
                Let's get back to the question we posed earlier: what would you do without a repeat button on your
                favorite music app? How would you memorize the lyrics to your new favorite song?
           </p>

           <p>
                When it comes to coding, we face a similar problem: we often want to tell the computer to <i>do something</i>
                repetitively, but don't want to deal with the redundancy that comes with manually giving such
                instructions. Thankfully, all programming languages have their own "repeat button" to work around this
                problem&mdash;we call these "repeat buttons" loops! As the name
                suggests, a <i>loop</i> simply repeats a snippet of code over <i>and over, and over, and over...</i>
                until we tell the computer to stop.
           </p>

           <p>
                To illustrate the power of loops, our students used them to draw the images below at this week's
                session&mdash;think about what sort of repetition comes with drawing each image, and how
                some action could be put "on repeat" in order to draw each picture. Struggling?
                Ask your student to explain!

           <h4>Coding, Cereal and Collaboration</h4>

           <p>
               If you'd asked our students and mentors what coding and cereal had in common before Saturday's
               session of Technovation, they'd probably tell you the similarities stopped after the first letter
               of each word. Perhaps someone would make the pun that they both have a notion of "bites/bytes"&mdash;but
               that's pushing it!
           </p>

           <p>
               If you asked our students and mentors what coding and cereal have in common <i>now</i>, however,
               they'd tell you the two are in fact deeply connected. Devan Sayles, an MSU alumna and computer scientist
               working at General Mills in Minneapolis, MN, joined this week's session and explained the
               many "bytes" that go into every "bite" of cereal. It's quite fascinating!
           </p>

               We kicked off this week's session with an intense debate over the question of whether or not
               a hot dog is a sandwich as students joined the Zoom link, reaching no
               official consensus&mdash;that said, we saw a number of strong arguments for both sides!
               We then dispersed into breakout rooms for our <i>real</i> icebreaker of the day, which
               proved to be a blast: <a href="https://skribbl.io/">skribbl.io</a>. Offering a version of
               online Pictionary, the site helped us get to know one another while putting our digital artistic
               skills to the test. If you're looking for a fun icebreaker for your next virtual meeting,
               we highly recommend.

                Following our icebreaker, we were joined by guest speaker Devan Sayles, an MSU alumna and computer scientist
                working at General Mills in Minneapolis, MN for this week's spotlight. Discussing her own
                journey into computer science from the computer games of her childhood to her college experience
                and life as a professional, Devan reiterated the fact that computer science can take you anywhere
                and reminded us that <i>coding is fun, even when it's your job</i> ! Connecting the role of data in the food industry
                to the role of programming in problem-solving, Devan gave us a fascinating look into her work as
                a <i>data engineer</i> at General Mills while explaining how her team ultimately puts
                cereal in your bowl every morning.

               Join us in thanking Devan for the wonderful talk!

                Next, we dove into <a href="https://runestone.academy/">Runestone</a>, picking up where we left
                off from last week. With the general idea of programming&mdash;the process of writing a program,
                or set of instructions for a computer to follow&mdash;under our belt, we worked together in
                breakout rooms to write a number of basic Python programs, each of which each drew a picture
                using the Turtle Graphics module. Using the commands
                <code>forward, backward, left, right, circle, up, down, goto</code> and <code>color</code>
                one after another, we saw how programming is quite similar to training a dog!
                Unlike a dog, however, the computer will do exactly what we tell it to&mdash;so the key is in
                ensuring we tell it to do <i>exactly</i> what we want it to do: capitalization, spelling and
                punctuation included.

               Though we briefly touched on <i>loops</i> and <i>variables</i>, we'll dive deeper into those concepts
               at next week's session. After all, there's no point in rushing through content at the expense of fun!
               We're taking our time to build a foundation&mdash;the rest of the structure comes much more easily once the foundation is set.

                Happy coding, Technovators! We'll see you next Saturday.

               It often feels like 2020 has put our lives on pause&mdash;yet, Saturday was an occasion to
               press "play." Judging by the laughter, smiles and atmosphere, our inaugural virtual Technovation
               meeting was a success!

               Students broke the ice with one another in Zoom "breakout rooms," sharing a handful of
               images that describe themselves while finding common ground on their favorite foods, sports,
               TV shows, books and hobbies. Our mentors&mdash;current computer science students from MSU&mdash;introduced
               themselves with a game of Kahoot!, sharing fun facts and stories while students tried
               to guess what made
               <a href="contact.html">Hannah, Zosha, Sarah, Jonathon, Gigi, Temi, Judy and Andrew</a> unique.

               Following introductions and virtual team bonding, students filled out a
               pre-survey to let us know their level of coding experience and what they hoped
               to get out of this fall's session of Technovation&mdash;moving forward, this will help us
               ensure we tailor, transform and adapt Technovation to the ultimate leaders of our program: the students.

           <p>
               After the pre-survey, we hit the ground running&mdash;students logged into
               <a href="https://runestone.academy">runestone.academy</a> to get coding! Runestone is an open-source
               virtual learning platform built for computer science classes which bundles an interactive textbook with
               an online coding editor in a single environment, making it the perfect tool for our situation.

               Students learned what a computer program really <i>is</i>,
               what defines a programming language, and what coding is all about through a handful of examples using

            <p>
                In alignment with the guidance of Ingham County public health officials, Technovation will be
                offered Saturday mornings from 10a-12p via Zoom in a fully-remote format, beginning 10/17 and
                ending 11/21.

                Founded in 2018, Technovation is an MSU student-led coding club introducing
                Lansing-area 6-12th grade students to the wide world of computer science.
                Combining games and mini-projects with guest speakers and team-building activities,
                Technovation is more than just another extracurricular—it’s a community.
                We believe coding should be <i>fun</i>, and we aim to make it so!

            <p>
                To protect students and faculty in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Technovation has been suspended indefinitely and will
                be succeeded by SPARCC (SPARtan Coding Club), a fully-remote coding club slated to
                launch in Spring 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                Run by students for students, current MSU students will guide current 6-12th grade students
                through an exciting, engaging and empowering learning experience. Building upon the foundation established by
                Technovation and Spartan Girls Who Code, SPARCC is reimagining what's possible in our post-pandemic world and raising the bar of virtual education.
            </p>
