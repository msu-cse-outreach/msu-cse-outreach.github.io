                <p>
                    This spring, we will be offering Spartan Girls Who Code, an MSU student-led coding club introducing 6-12th grade students to the wide world of computing. Combining games and mini-projects with guest speakers and team-building activities, SGWC is more than just another extracurricular—it’s a community. We believe coding should be fun, and we aim to make it so! There will be both in-person and virtual sessions, local students are highly encouraged to
                    register for the in person sessions. We will be teaching a web development curriculum, using both HTML and CSS.

            <h4>Ready to Go?</h4>
            <p>
                Already our last week? We're so proud of the Students for all their work over the last 8 weeks. We're so excited to see their final projects!
            </p>
            <p>
                Our students jumped into their final projects on Saturday, unleashing their creativity in full force through the curves and contours drawn by our favorite Python-powered mascot, Tracy the Turtle. Building upon the final project blueprints laid at last Saturday's meeting, students wasted no time getting to work! As soon as they'd been cleared for takeoff, our students tilted their wings back and took flight, trusting that their curiosity would keep them afloat. Indeed, it did&mdash;the only time students came back down to Earth was at the end of our meeting!
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we dive into a full recap of our meeting, we've got a few key announcements to share.

                <p>
                    This spring, we will be offering Spartan Girls Who Code, an MSU student-led coding club introducing 6-12th grade students to the wide world of computing. Combining games and mini-projects with guest speakers and team-building activities, SGWC is more than just another extracurricular—it’s a community. We believe coding should be fun, and we aim to make it so! There will be both in-person and virtual sessions, local students are highly encouraged to
                    register for the in person sessions. We will be teaching a web development curriculum, using both HTML and CSS.

                            Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from India.                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                            I started by learning LOGO (very similar to the python turtle some of us are learning here) and amazed at how we could easily convert our ideas into pictures on the screen.                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                            I created a shopping website to sell my favorite badminton equipments.                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                            I'm trying to understand how we reason about things and in turn teach a computer to do it.                        </p>

                            <b>What advice do you have for our students?</b><br>
                            Always question why you are learning something.                         </p>

            <h2>Week 6</h2>
            <h4>All Part of the Plan</h4>
            <p>
                Success begins with a plan for success&mdash;to win a sporting match, ace a test, or learn a new skill, we must begin with a plan. Positive planning is powerful!
            </p>
            <p>
                This week, students review basics, loops, and functions. Students were also introduced to their final projects! Next Saturday, students will begin to start implementing these final projects by leveraging their newfound Python knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Virtual</b> Students broke the ice by doing their very own Virtual Escape Room!
                <a href="https://roomescapemaker.com/u/demo/dogescape">Dog Escape</a>,
                Students and mentors had a lot of fun in the escape room and definitely allowed for a fun way to start Saturday's session!
            </p>
            <span class="image main"><img src="assets/img/week6/escape.png" alt="Dog Escape!"></span>

            <p>
                <b>In-Person</b> Students broke the ice by creating and sharing their very own works of digital art this week!
                <a href="https://sandspiel.club/">Sandspiel</a>,
                <a href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/draw-to-art">Google's Draw to Art</a>, and
                <a href="https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/">WebGL Fluid Simulation</a>
                are all great examples of how computer science cuts across disciplinary boundaries&mdash;code empowers artists to create, share, and innovate in their art. We often draw a line between the arts &amp; humanities and technology&mdash;but the two are closer than ever in today's day and age!
            </p>
    
            <p>
                After Icebreaker's from Virtual and In-Person Cohorts, we jumped into a review of loops, functions, variables, user input, and all of the other programming concepts we've covered this fall using Kahoot. A bit of friendly competition is always a good time&mdash;everyone wins when we learn together!

                Following a review of basics, loops, and functions, both In-Person and Virtual mentors introduced our final project! In week 7, students and mentors will brainstorm a plan for success on our final projects! The final projects are completely open-ended and designed to showcase the Python Turtle Graphics programming skills students have picked up over the course of the fall&mdash;they provide a unique opportunity for students to tie together loops, functions, variables, and user input in a single program.

            <h4>Fun with Functions</h4>
            <p>
                We're surrounded by black boxes&mdash;tools that <i>just work</i> when used to complete a task. To most of us, cars are black boxes getting us from point A to point B; TVs are black boxes streaming video and audio into our living room; and phones are black boxes connecting us to our friends and family through social media, texts and calls. Black boxes make our world better&mdash;they make complex tasks easy and empower us to accomplish more with less time and energy. It's impossible to imagine modern life without them!
            </p>
            <p>
                In computer science, these black boxes take the form of <i>functions</i>&mdash;structures that hide the details of a complex task behind a simple statement. Functions <i>just work</i>, allowing us to think about other, higher-level concepts when writing code. This week, our coders learned how to write and call their own functions in Python&mdash;though you might just say they had fun with functions!

                In-Person Students kicked off Saturdays's session with a Spotlight from one of our mentors, Jonathon! The students were able to see the games Jonathon has developed and even got a chance to play them!

            <p>
                In this week's spotlight, Virtual-Technovation met Sophia: the first robot declared a citizen by Saudi Arabia! Student's learned what defines Artifical Intelligence: the ability for a computer to think and learn. With AI, computers can perform tasks that are typically done by people. Ask your students about how Artificial Intelligence is used to create Sophia!

                Following our Spotlight, mentors introduced functions! Functions allow us to simplify our code by serving as black boxes: they hide the complexities of a task behind a single statement and allow us to think about higher-level concepts when writing code. In a sense, functions teach Tracy the Turtle new tricks!

                            <b>What did you study?</b><br>
                            I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 1984!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                            The first time I ever learned anything about computing was in 1970.  A sophomore majoring in math at Kalamazoo College, I took a class on programming in Fortran. The next year I transferred to UMich, where math majors had to also have a 'cognate' (minor). Since I liked my programming class at K, I decided to make computing my cognate at UMich, learning Cobol and Algol. After graduation I had a chance to teach programming and math at Eastern Montana College. By that time I had flipped my allegiances. I still liked math, but I loved computing!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                            I taught coding and IT at a week-long residential summer camp for secondary school girls and their teachers in Rwanda for three summers. It was the opportunity of a lifetime to work with the Peace Corps in Rwanda on empowering young women in a third world country to pursue educations in technology!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                            I think that code can play a role in uplifting all who want to make their world a better, and more equitable one. I hope to uplift a few, who will uplift more, who will uplift even more, ...

                            <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                            I worked on Statistical Energy Analysis with mechanical engineers, using this tool to make cars quieter. I used C# to create their models; it was pure object-oriented-programming. Loved it!

                            I want to be better at what I do; I constantly look for new ways to teach and engage my students. Recently, I have been applying the flipped learning techniques to my Algorithms and Data Structures class. Next step will be incorporating peer programming.

            <p>
                Ever feel like you're running in circles? Our students and mentors did at Saturday's lesson, but don't worry&mdash;those circles were all part of the plan! Saturday's lesson introduced <i>loops</i> for the <b>In-Person Cohort</b> and a review for <b>Virtual Cohorts</b>. Loops are a type of programming structure which tells a computer to repeat a set of instructions over, and over, and over, and over, ..., and over. As their name suggests, loops quite literally tell a computer to go in circles&mdash;we weren't spinning alone!

            <p>
               <b>Virtual Cohorts</b> opened this week's meeting with a spotlight video on gaming! It was so neat to see how fascinated the students were by learning about the gaming industry and computer science!

            <p>
                Next Saturday, we'll be introducing variables, structures which allow us to store information in our program during runtime. If you're feeling behind, however, don't fret&mdash;we'll also dedicate a significant chunk of time to reviewing loops, functions, and the other key concepts we've covered in Weeks 1-4. The best way to become a better programmer is to program more&mdash;and that's exactly what we plan to do in Week 5!

                After <b>Virtual Technovation</b> had a brief recap of the programming concepts we've learned from previous weeks&mdash;including basic movement commands, variables and user-input&mdash;we introduced loops.

            <p>
                Despite the fast pace of Saturday's lesson, students and mentors slowed down towards the end of the meeting for an insightful reflection and discussion. We agreed it would benefit us all to dedicate this coming Saturday to review, as it's key we feel comfortable with loops, colors, variables and input before moving further ahead in our curriculum! If your student felt challenged or behind at last week's meeting, let them know they'll have plenty of time to get caught up this week&mdash;no Technovator will be left behind!

            <h4>Variables, inputs, and colors!</h4>
            <p>
                <b>Virtual Technovation</b> and <b>In-Person Technovation</b> had a lot of fun learning about variables and inputs. Our students and mentors explored the possibilities of colors and how you can use certain commands to add creativity to your code through the lesson.

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Students kicked off this week by getting to know each other and their mentors with a name-sharing icebreaker. Students got the chance to introduce themselves to some of the mentors and classmates while simultaneously trying to remember everyone else's name in their group.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the icebreaker, Saturday's lesson began with an uplifting spotlight video from Khan Academy. Introducing the definition of a growth mindset and how it differs from a fixed mindset, the spotlight underscored the importance of bringing a growth mindset to Technovation every week. Learning to code is difficult, but the challenges we overcome as we navigate this learning process will ultimately make us stronger&mdash;we simply need to change the way we see failure! If we view it as an opportunity for improvement instead of a setback, we'll go far&mdash;if we're feeling down, we simply need to turn our frown upside-down and remember that all experiences are learning experiences!

            </div>
            <p>
                After students learned how to change the color of Tracy's pen with the color command, students learned how to fill in the shapes they had drawn with the begin_fill and end_fill commands. Students also learned how to increase the thickness of trail Tracy leaves with the pensize command.
            </p>
            <div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">

            </div>
            <p>
                Finally, we learned how to use the setposition and speed commands to fine-tune Tracy's behavior: setposition allows Tracy to move to specific positions on the screen, while speed allows Tracy to move faster or slower! Ask your student to show you these commands in action&mdash;they're pretty cool!

                As usual, students concluded Saturday's meeting with a brief reflection and discussion around what went well, what didn't go so well, and what excites them about the week ahead. We hope they're as excited as we are for Week 3!

            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <h4>Three Times the Fun</h4>
            <p>
                Saturday marked the start of not one, not two, but <b>three</b> Technovation Cohorts&mdash;making for not one, not two, but three times the fun! Thanks to generous support from <a href="https://www.ford.com/">Ford Motor Company</a> and continued funding from the <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/">Michigan State University College of Engineering</a>, we've brought back the local Lansing club—our In-Person Cohort—while continuing to engage students all across the great state of Michigan in an All-Michigan club consisting of two cohorts—our Green Cohort and our White Cohort.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we dive into a full recap of our first meeting, we've got a few announcements to share!
            </p>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
            <ul>
                <h4>1. Consent Forms</h4>
                <p>
                    We're still missing parental consent forms for half of our students! If you have not yet submitted a <a href="https://forms.gle/451DLGFcr7j9WNSK9">Fall 2022 Technovation Consent Form</a> for each of your students registered for Technovation, please do so as soon as possible. This form is required by MSU Youth Program Policy, and should take no more than 5 minutes to complete.
                </p>
                <h4>2. Remind</h4>
                <p>
                    If you haven't already, subscribe to our Remind service to receive instant updates about the Fall 2022 session of Technovation! Text <b>@f22tech</b> to <b>81010</b> or follow <a href="https://www.remind.com/join/f22tech">this link</a> to subscribe. We'll continue to send weekly updates via email, but we know how full inboxes can become!
                </p>
                <h4>3. Participant Pre-Survey</h4>
                <p>
                    We asked students to fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/QFYb5pM1zHu3FWdHA">In-Person Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> and <a href="https://forms.gle/qJwdk6YgLAh9YCjv7">Virtual Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> at Saturday's meeting, but not everyone submitted their responses. If your student has not yet completed the pre-survey, please have them do so before this Saturday's meeting.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Bonus Hour</h4>
                <p>
                    Back by popular demand, we'll be hosting a Technovation "bonus hour" every Thursday from 7-8p ET (beginning this Thursday, 9/29) open to all Technovation participants. At least two Technovation mentors will be available on Zoom during the bonus hour to resolve technical difficulties, dive deeper into the coding concepts we've learned, or to talk about computer science in general! Join us at the link below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style: disc">Bonus Hour Zoom: <a href="https://msu.zoom.us/j/92645747814">zoom</a> (password: see email)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>5. Looking Ahead</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll see you again this Saturday, 10/1 at 10:30a ET for our second Technovation meeting of the fall! Zoom links will be the same as last week&mdash;we will send them out again on Saturday morning if you've lost them. For In-Person Technovation,  we will see you back in the Basement Galleries at the <a href="https://www.cadl.org/about/our-locations/downtown-lansing">Downtown Branch of the Capital Area District Library</a>.
                    Looking further ahead, we'll be meeting every Saturday through 11/19 at 10:30a ET.
                </p>
                <h4>6. Three Cohorts</h4>
                <p>
                    As we mentioned above, we're running three cohorts of Technovation this fall in order to serve students all across the state of Michigan and to also offer an in-person option for those in the Lansing area. Content covered in each cohort will be equivalent&mdash;cohorts encourage student-mentor interaction by decreasing group sizes. If you're unsure which cohort your student is in, check the subject line of the welcome email sent last week.
                </p>
                <h4>7. Questions?</h4>
                <p>
                    As always, please reach out with any questions / concerns / ideas / feedback to <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Our students wasted no time getting started, jumping fearlessly into introductions and icebreakers! Following a brief overview of Technovation and the plan for each weekly meeting this fall, students in each cohort collaborated to draft their very own club contract, laying out their shared expectations and goals towards which to strive this fall. Check out the contracts below&mdash;we're impressed with what our students came up with!
            </p>
            <div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">
                <div class="row">

                    <div class="col-md-4" align="middle">
                        <img class="shadow-lg" src="assets/img/week1/mi_contract.png" width=90%>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="row">
                    <p><i>Club contracts from each cohort of Fall 2022 Technovation. Ask your student what their goals are for the fall, and what they hope to get out of their experience!</i></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                After completing the Club contracts, we asked coders in our In-Person Cohort to fill the <a href="https://forms.gle/QFYb5pM1zHu3FWdHA">In-Person Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> and coders in our Green and White Cohorts to fill the <a href="https://forms.gle/qJwdk6YgLAh9YCjv7">Virtual Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a>. If your student did not submit this survey because they arrived late or just ran out of time, please ask them to do so. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Students then created CodeHS accounts and began to work through the first few exercises in the <a href="https://codehs.com/course/introtracy/overview">Intro to Python with Tracy</a> course. See the video below for a brief introduction to Tracy and an overview of the programming your students will be learning!

            </div>
            <p>
                Students concluded the session with a reflection and discussion around what went well, what didn't go so well, and what excites them about the week ahead&mdash;and just like that, our two hours were up! Time flies when we're having fun&mdash;we're already looking forward to next Saturday.
            </p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Mentor Spotlight</h4>
            <p>
                The Mentor/Advisor Spotlight! Technovation is led, organized, and run by MSU students under the guidance of advisors from MSU and Ford. The Mentor/Advisor Spotlight introduces a few of our team members each week to help coders get to know them better. Feel free to ask mentors and advisors for more information about their hobbies and past experiences during the Thursday Bonus Hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                To kick off our spotlight series, we'd like to introduce the Fall 2022 Lead Mentors!

                            <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                            I took AP Computer Science A in high school which I really enjoyed, and I participated in Kode With Klossy over the summer which was a lot of fun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                            I developed an iOS app that gives users different dessert recipes based on a region of the world they choose, which can help them learn about different food around the world!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                            I hope to get more into machine learning research.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>What advice do you have for our students?</b><br>
                            Don't be afraid to ask questions. There is no such thing as a stupid question!

            <h2>Fall 2022</h2>

            <p>
                We're excited to announce that new funding from the
                <a href="https://www.ford.com/">Ford Motor
                Company</a> and
                continued funding from <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/">Michigan
                State University College of Engineering</a> will allow Technovation to serve
                two locations this fall&mdash;In-Person Lansing and Virtual
                All Michigan!
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded in 2018, Technovation is an MSU student-led coding club introducing
                6-12th grade students in Michigan to the wide world of computer science.
                Combining games and mini-projects with guest speakers and team-building activities,
                Technovation is more than just another extracurricular—it's a community.
                We believe coding should be <i>fun</i>, and we aim to make it so!

                To protect students and faculty in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Technovation has been suspended indefinitely and will
                be succeeded by SPARCC (SPARtan Coding Club), a fully-remote coding club slated to
                launch in Spring 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                Run by students for students, current MSU students will guide current 6-12th grade students
                through an exciting, engaging and empowering learning experience. Building upon the foundation established by
                Technovation and Spartan Girls Who Code, SPARCC is reimagining what's possible in our post-pandemic world and raising the bar of virtual education.
            </p>
