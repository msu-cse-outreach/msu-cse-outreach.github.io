            <h4>Two Times the Fun</h4>
            <p>
                Saturday marked the start of not one, but <b>two</b> Technovation clubs&mdash;making for not one, but two times the fun! Thanks to generous support from <a href="https://www.ford.com/">Ford Motor Company</a> and continued funding from the <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/">Michigan State University College of Engineering</a>, we've expanded the scope of Technovation beyond the Greater Lansing area this fall to engage students all across the great state of Michigan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we dive into a full recap of our first meeting, we've got a few announcements to share!
            </p>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
            <ul>
                <h4>1. Consent Forms</h4>
                <p>
                    We're still missing parental consent forms for half of our students! If you have not yet submitted a <a href="https://forms.gle/451DLGFcr7j9WNSK9">Fall 2022 Technovation Consent Form</a> for each of your students registered for Technovation, please do so as soon as possible. This is required by MSU Youth Program Policy, and should take no more than 5 minutes to complete.
                </p>
                <h4>2. Remind</h4>
                <p>
                    If you haven't already, subscribe to our Remind service to receive instant updates about the Fall 2022 session of Technovation! Text <b>@f21tech</b> to <b>81010</b> or follow <a href="https://www.remind.com/join/f22tech">this link</a> to subscribe. We'll continue to send weekly updates via email, but we know how full inboxes can become!
                </p>
                <h4>3. Participant Pre-Survey</h4>
                <p>
                    Students were encouraged to fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/QFYb5pM1zHu3FWdHA">In-Person Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> and <a href="https://forms.gle/qJwdk6YgLAh9YCjv7">Virtual Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> at Saturday's meeting, but not everyone submitted their responses. If your student has not yet completed the pre-survey, please have them do so before this Saturday's meeting.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Bonus Hour</h4>
                <p>
                    Back by popular demand, we'll be hosting a Technovation "bonus hour" every Thursday from 7-8p ET (beginning this Thursday, 9/29) open to all Technovation participants. At least two Technovation mentors will be available on Zoom during the bonus hour to resolve technical difficulties, dive deeper into the coding concepts we've learned, or to talk about computer science in general! Join us at the link below:
                </p>

                </ul>
                <h4>5. Looking Ahead</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll see you again this Saturday, 10/1 at 10:30a ET for our second Technovation meeting of the fall! Zoom links will be the same as those used last week&mdash;we will send them out again on Saturday morning if you've lost them. For In-Person Technovation we will see you back at The  the basement events room at the <a href="https://www.cadl.org/about/our-locations/downtown-lansing">Downtown Branch of the Capital Area District Library</a>.
                    Looking further ahead, we'll be meeting every Saturday through 11/19 at 10:30a ET.
                </p>
                <h4>6. Geographic Cohorts</h4>
                <p>
                    As we mentioned above, we're running two sessions of Technovation this fall&mdash;split by geographic region&mdash;in order to broaden our reach and serve students all across the state of Michigan. Content covered in each geographic cohort will be equivalent&mdash;cohorts are just for organization, and encourage student-mentor interaction by decreasing group sizes. If you're unsure of which cohort your student is in, check the subject line of the welcome email sent last week!
                </p>
                <h4>7. Questions?</h4>
                <p>
                    As always, please reach out with any questions / concerns / ideas / feedback to <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Our students wasted no time getting started, jumping fearlessly into introductions and icebreakers! Following a brief overview of Technovation and the plan for each weekly meeting this fall, students in each cohort collaborated to draft their very own club contract, laying out their shared expectations and goals towards which to strive this fall. Check out the contracts below&mdash;we're impressed with what our students came up with!
            </p>

                After our Club contracts, students filled the <a href="https://forms.gle/QFYb5pM1zHu3FWdHA">In-Person Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> and <a href="https://forms.gle/qJwdk6YgLAh9YCjv7">Virtual Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> to share their interests and prior experience with us&mdash;if your student did not submit this survey, please encourage them to do so. Students then created CodeHS accounts and began to work through the first few exercises in the <a href="https://codehs.com/course/introtracy/overview">Intro to Python with Tracy</a> course we'll be completing together in Technovation this fall. See the video below for a brief introduction to Tracy and an overview of the sort of programming our students will be learning!

            <p>
                Students concluded the session with a reflection and discussion around what went well, what didn't go so well, and what excites them about the week ahead&mdash;and just like that, our two hours were up! Time flies when we're having fun&mdash;we're already looking forward to next Saturday.

            <h4 class="text-center">Mentor Spotlight</h4>
            <p>
                This fall, we'll be including a new section in our weekly newsletter: the Mentor/Advisor Spotlight! Technovation is led, organized, and run by MSU students under the guidance of faculty advisors from MSU and Ford, and we thought it would be fun to introduce a few of our team members each week.
            </p>
            <p>
                To kick off our spotlight series, we'd like to introduce the Fall 2022 Lead Mentors!

                            I first became interested in computer science in my first computer science class; I didn't know if I'd like it but I became hooked on the problem solving aspect of it all.

                We're excited to announce that new funding from the
                <a href="https://www.ford.com/">Ford Motor
                Company</a> and
                continued funding from <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/">Michigan
                State University College of Engineering</a> will allow Technovation to serve
                two locations this fall&mdash;In-Person Lansing and Virtual
                All Michigan!

            <p>
                Founded in 2018, Technovation is an MSU student-led coding club introducing
                6-12th grade students in Michigan to the wide world of computer science.
                Combining games and mini-projects with guest speakers and team-building activities,
                Technovation is more than just another extracurricular—it's a community.
                We believe coding should be <i>fun</i>, and we aim to make it so!

            <p>
                To protect students and faculty in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Technovation has been suspended indefinitely and will
                be succeeded by SPARCC (SPARtan Coding Club), a fully-remote coding club slated to
                launch in Spring 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                Run by students for students, current MSU students will guide current 6-12th grade students
                through an exciting, engaging and empowering learning experience. Building upon the foundation established by
                Technovation and Spartan Girls Who Code, SPARCC is reimagining what's possible in our post-pandemic world and raising the bar of virtual education.
            </p>
