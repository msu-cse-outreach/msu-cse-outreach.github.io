            <h4>Time is moving fast!</h4>
            <p>
                This week Virtual and In-Person Cohorts had a bit of a different pace learning all about variables, inputs, and loops!
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we dive into a full recap of our meeting, we've got a few key announcements to share.
            </p>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
            <ul>
                <h4>1. Bonus Hour</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll be continuing to host a Bonus Hour every Thursday from 7-8p ET, and invite all Technovation participants to join us. At least two Technovation mentors will be available on Zoom during the bonus hour to resolve technical difficulties, dive deeper into the coding concepts we've learned, or to talk about computer science in general! Join us at the link below:
                </p>

                <h4>2. Curriculum Check-In</h4>
                <p>
                    We've moved quickly in the first three weeks of Technovation! To make sure everyone's feeling comfortable with the content we've covered so far, we'll be dedicating this Saturday's lesson to review and practice. If you missed a previous week's lesson or are feeling behind, hang in there and join us this Saturday. We'll make sure you're caught up before diving into anything new&mdash;no Technovator will be left behind!
                </p>

                <h4>3. Looking Ahead</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll see you again this Saturday, 10/15 at 10:30a ET for our fourth Technovation meeting of the fall! Zoom links will be the same as those used last week&mdash;we will send them out again on Saturday morning if you've lost them. Looking further ahead, we'll be meeting every Saturday through 11/20 at 10a ET.
                </p>

                Despite the fast pace of Saturday's lesson, students and mentors slowed down towards the end of the meeting for an insightful reflection and discussion. We agreed it would benefit us all to dedicate this coming Saturday to review, as it's key we feel comfortable with loops, colors, variables and input before moving further ahead in our curriculum! If your student felt challenged or behind at last week's meeting, let them know they'll have plenty of time to get caught up this week&mdash;no Technovator will be left behind!

                            <b>What advice do you have for our students?</b><br>
                            Think before you code; you always got to visualize what your output should be before coding.                         </p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Students kicked off this week by getting to know each other and their mentors with a name-sharing icebreaker. Students got the chance to introduce themselves to some of the mentors and classmates while simultaneously trying to remember everyone else's name in their group.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the icebreaker, Saturday's lesson began with an uplifting spotlight video from Khan Academy. Introducing the definition of a growth mindset and how it differs from a fixed mindset, the spotlight underscored the importance of bringing a growth mindset to Technovation every week. Learning to code is difficult, but the challenges we overcome as we navigate this learning process will ultimately make us stronger&mdash;we simply need to change the way we see failure! If we view it as an opportunity for improvement instead of a setback, we'll go far&mdash;if we're feeling down, we simply need to turn our frown upside-down and remember that all experiences are learning experiences!

                After students learned how to change the color of Tracy's pen with the color command, students learned how to fill in the shapes they had drawn with the begin_fill and end_fill commands. Students also learned how to increase the thickness of trail Tracy leaves with the pensize command.

                Finally, we learned how to use the setposition and speed commands to fine-tune Tracy's behavior: setposition allows Tracy to move to specific positions on the screen, while speed allows Tracy to move faster or slower! Ask your student to show you these commands in action&mdash;they're pretty cool!

                As usual, students concluded Saturday's meeting with a brief reflection and discussion around what went well, what didn't go so well, and what excites them about the week ahead. We hope they're as excited as we are for Week 3!

            <h4>Three Times the Fun</h4>
            <p>
                Saturday marked the start of not one, not two, but <b>three</b> Technovation Cohorts&mdash;making for not one, not two, but three times the fun! Thanks to generous support from <a href="https://www.ford.com/">Ford Motor Company</a> and continued funding from the <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/">Michigan State University College of Engineering</a>, we've brought back the local Lansing club—our In-Person Cohort—while continuing to engage students all across the great state of Michigan in an All-Michigan club consisting of two cohorts—our Green Cohort and our White Cohort.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we dive into a full recap of our first meeting, we've got a few announcements to share!
            </p>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
            <ul>
                <h4>1. Consent Forms</h4>
                <p>
                    We're still missing parental consent forms for half of our students! If you have not yet submitted a <a href="https://forms.gle/451DLGFcr7j9WNSK9">Fall 2022 Technovation Consent Form</a> for each of your students registered for Technovation, please do so as soon as possible. This form is required by MSU Youth Program Policy, and should take no more than 5 minutes to complete.
                </p>
                <h4>2. Remind</h4>
                <p>
                    If you haven't already, subscribe to our Remind service to receive instant updates about the Fall 2022 session of Technovation! Text <b>@f22tech</b> to <b>81010</b> or follow <a href="https://www.remind.com/join/f22tech">this link</a> to subscribe. We'll continue to send weekly updates via email, but we know how full inboxes can become!
                </p>
                <h4>3. Participant Pre-Survey</h4>
                <p>
                    We asked students to fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/QFYb5pM1zHu3FWdHA">In-Person Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> and <a href="https://forms.gle/qJwdk6YgLAh9YCjv7">Virtual Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> at Saturday's meeting, but not everyone submitted their responses. If your student has not yet completed the pre-survey, please have them do so before this Saturday's meeting.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Bonus Hour</h4>
                <p>
                    Back by popular demand, we'll be hosting a Technovation "bonus hour" every Thursday from 7-8p ET (beginning this Thursday, 9/29) open to all Technovation participants. At least two Technovation mentors will be available on Zoom during the bonus hour to resolve technical difficulties, dive deeper into the coding concepts we've learned, or to talk about computer science in general! Join us at the link below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style: disc">Bonus Hour Zoom: <a href="https://msu.zoom.us/j/92645747814">zoom</a> (password: see email)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>5. Looking Ahead</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll see you again this Saturday, 10/1 at 10:30a ET for our second Technovation meeting of the fall! Zoom links will be the same as last week&mdash;we will send them out again on Saturday morning if you've lost them. For In-Person Technovation,  we will see you back in the Basement Galleries at the <a href="https://www.cadl.org/about/our-locations/downtown-lansing">Downtown Branch of the Capital Area District Library</a>.
                    Looking further ahead, we'll be meeting every Saturday through 11/19 at 10:30a ET.
                </p>
                <h4>6. Three Cohorts</h4>
                <p>
                    As we mentioned above, we're running three cohorts of Technovation this fall in order to serve students all across the state of Michigan and to also offer an in-person option for those in the Lansing area. Content covered in each cohort will be equivalent&mdash;cohorts encourage student-mentor interaction by decreasing group sizes. If you're unsure which cohort your student is in, check the subject line of the welcome email sent last week.
                </p>
                <h4>7. Questions?</h4>
                <p>
                    As always, please reach out with any questions / concerns / ideas / feedback to <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Our students wasted no time getting started, jumping fearlessly into introductions and icebreakers! Following a brief overview of Technovation and the plan for each weekly meeting this fall, students in each cohort collaborated to draft their very own club contract, laying out their shared expectations and goals towards which to strive this fall. Check out the contracts below&mdash;we're impressed with what our students came up with!
            </p>
            <div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">

            </div>
            <p>
                After completing the Club contracts, we asked coders in our In-Person Cohort to fill the <a href="https://forms.gle/QFYb5pM1zHu3FWdHA">In-Person Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> and coders in our Green and White Cohorts to fill the <a href="https://forms.gle/qJwdk6YgLAh9YCjv7">Virtual Fall 2022 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a>. If your student did not submit this survey because they arrived late or just ran out of time, please ask them to do so. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Students then created CodeHS accounts and began to work through the first few exercises in the <a href="https://codehs.com/course/introtracy/overview">Intro to Python with Tracy</a> course.

                Students concluded the session with a reflection and discussion around what went well, what didn't go so well, and what excites them about the week ahead&mdash;and just like that, our two hours were up! Time flies when we're having fun&mdash;we're already looking forward to next Saturday.

            <h4 class="text-center">Mentor Spotlight</h4>
            <p>
                The Mentor/Advisor Spotlight! Technovation is led, organized, and run by MSU students under the guidance of advisors from MSU and Ford. The Mentor/Advisor Spotlight introduces a few of our team members each week to help coders get to know them better. Feel free to ask mentors and advisors for more information about their hobbies and past experiences during the Thursday Bonus Hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                To kick off our spotlight series, we'd like to introduce the Fall 2022 Lead Mentors!

                To protect students and faculty in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Technovation has been suspended indefinitely and will
                be succeeded by SPARCC (SPARtan Coding Club), a fully-remote coding club slated to
                launch in Spring 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                Run by students for students, current MSU students will guide current 6-12th grade students
                through an exciting, engaging and empowering learning experience. Building upon the foundation established by
                Technovation and Spartan Girls Who Code, SPARCC is reimagining what's possible in our post-pandemic world and raising the bar of virtual education.
