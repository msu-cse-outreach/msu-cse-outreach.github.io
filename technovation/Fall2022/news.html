                Lights? On. Brakes? Released. Throttle? Forward. Liftoff? Complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our students jumped into their final projects on Saturday, unleashing their creativity in full force through the curves and contours drawn by our favorite Python-powered mascot, Tracy the Turtle. Building upon the final project blueprints laid at last Saturday's meeting, students wasted no time getting to work! As soon as they'd been cleared for takeoff, our students tilted their wings back and took flight, trusting that their curiosity would keep them afloat. Indeed, it did&mdash;the only time students came back down to Earth was at the end of our meeting!
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we dive into a full recap of our meeting, we've got a few key announcements to share.
            </p>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
            <ul>
                <h4>1. Bonus Hour</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll be hosting our final Bonus Hour this Thursday from 7-8p ET, and invite all Technovation participants to join us. At least two Technovation mentors will be available on Zoom during the bonus hour to help with final projects, or to talk about computer science in general! Join us at the link below:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="list-style: disc">Bonus Hour Zoom: <a href="https://msu.zoom.us/j/94549597984">https://msu.zoom.us/j/94549597984</a> (password: see email)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2. Curriculum Check-In</h4>
                <p>
                    This coming Saturday marks Week 8&mdash;our final week of the fall! We'll be dedicating the meeting to a final project wrap-up and presentation, in addition to a guest spotlight and certificate of completion ceremony. Let's finish strong!
                </p>
                <h4>3. Looking Ahead</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll see you again this Saturday, 11/20 at 10a ET for our final Technovation meeting of the fall! Zoom links will be the same as those used last week&mdash;we will send them out again on Saturday morning if you've lost them.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Questions?</h4>
                <p>
                    As always, please reach out with any questions / concerns / ideas / feedback to <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                This week's icebreaker featured a hybrid scavenger hunt&mdash;physical in the sense that students sought physical objects&mdash;but virtual in the sense that we all remained on Zoom, of course! 2D, webcam-filtered coffee mug? Check. 2D, webcam-filtered envelope? Check. 2D, webcam-filtered pencil? Check!
            </p>
            <p>
                A handful of students turned on their cameras for the first time of the fall when showing their scavenger hunt finds, and our mentors appreciated the opportunity to match faces with names in our world of black boxes! We hope to see more of our students (who are comfortable) on camera next week during our final celebration; it's a joy to see everyone smile!

            <p>
                After our scavenger hunt, we had the privilege to hear from Mark Roberts for a live spotlight. Mark, an Application Security Evangelist at Ford and self-proclaimed "scary cybersecurity guy," brought his energetic presence through the screen and shared the story of his trajectory from a background in biology to a successful career spanning computer science, technology, and cybersecurity. Mark shared his number-one piece of security advice&mdash;to avoid reusing passwords&mdash;and shared higher-level takeaways from his years of experience leading security training programs. Mark reminded us that we're all human, prone to making mistakes&mdash;but that proper safeguards against those mistakes can make all the difference!
            </p>
            <p>
                As usual, our students followed-up on Mark's spotlight with an avalanche of great questions, spurring a lively discussion and sense of energy that persisted long after Mark signed off. Join us in thanking Mark for generously sharing his Saturday morning with our students.

                The remainder of Saturday's meeting was reserved for final project work time. Aside from a brief set of 2 mentor : 1 student check-ins to answer questions, address concerns, discuss new ideas and troubleshoot bugs, mentors left students with clear airspace to continue implementing their final projects. We're happy to report that every student hit cruising altitude&mdash;every student's takeoff was successful!

                Next Saturday, students will have 30 minutes to request clearance for landing and wrap up their final projects. Thereafter, students will taxi their project to the gate for display to their peers in an open Google Slides Gallery! Within the gallery, students will have the opportunity to leave compliments on one anothers' projects and draw inspiration for future creations. Outside of the gallery, we'll be hosting Dr. Marwa Farag from Ford as our final spotlight speaker, and concluding the session with a certificate of completion ceremony. Let's finish strong!

                            <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                            I wrote code to collect and process head and neck accelerations of humans and human analogs (crash dummies) for impact injury experiments at a Navy research lab.

                            <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                            There have been many times&mdash;I have enjoyed coding in all stages of my study. Coding has been a part of my daily life for many years. In terms of outcome, the most exciting time has been when I coded machine learning models and algorithms that can extract meaning from natural language text during my PhD research.  
                        </p>

                            Listen, learn and gain knowledge and seek advice from your resources, knowledgeable people around you to carefully set your goals, then work hard and be stubborn in reaching your goals. In this way you can minimize the influence of discouraging biases and cheap roamers around you and be successful!

            <h2>Week 6</h2>
            <h4>All Part of the Plan</h4>
            <p>
                Success begins with a plan for success&mdash;to win a sporting match, ace a test, or learn a new skill, we must begin with a plan! As coaches, teachers, and parents love to say, a failure to plan is a plan doomed for failure. Positive planning is powerful!
            </p>
            <p>
                This week, students practiced their planning skills by brainstorming ideas for final projects. Next Saturday, students will be implementing these final projects by leveraging their newfound Python knowledge, and on the following Saturday, students will present their final projects to their peers in a grand finale celebration session. Sounds like a plan for success, eh?
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we dive into a full recap of our meeting, we've got a few key announcements to share.
            </p>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
            <ul>
                <h4>1. Bonus Hour</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll be continuing to host a Bonus Hour every Thursday from 7-8p ET, and invite all Technovation participants to join us. At least two Technovation mentors will be available on Zoom during the bonus hour to resolve technical difficulties, dive deeper into the coding concepts we've learned, or to talk about computer science in general! Join us at the link below:

                <p>
                    We'll be dedicating the majority of Week 7 to final project work time! We'll also plan for a brief content review, icebreaker, and spotlight, as usual. If you missed a previous week's lesson or are feeling behind, hang in there and join us at Bonus Hour, then again this Saturday. We'll make sure you're caught up&mdash;no Technovator will be left behind! Let's finish strong!
                </p>
                <h4>3. Looking Ahead</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll see you again this Saturday, 11/13 at 10a ET for our seventh Technovation meeting of the fall! Zoom links will be the same as those used last week&mdash;we will send them out again on Saturday morning if you've lost them. Looking further ahead, we'll be meeting every Saturday through 11/20 at 10a ET.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Questions?</h4>

            <p>
                Students broke the ice by creating and sharing their very own works of digital art this week!
                <a href="https://sandspiel.club/">Sandspiel</a>,
                <a href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/draw-to-art">Google's Draw to Art</a>, and
                <a href="https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/">WebGL Fluid Simulation</a>
                are all great examples of how computer science cuts across disciplinary boundaries&mdash;code empowers artists to create, share, and innovate in their art. We often draw a line between the arts &amp; humanities and technology&mdash;but the two are closer than ever in today's day and age!
            </p>
            <p>
                Following our adventure into the world of digital art, we met Taylor Jones for a live spotlight. Taylor is a Coaching Service Manager within the Transformation Office at Ford, and shared stories from her journey into the intersection of technology, management, and leadership! Our students brought thoughtful questions (as always), making for a great conversation. We thank Taylor for taking time out of her busy Saturday to share her insights, advice, and encouragement!

                After Taylor's spotlight, we jumped into a review of loops, functions, variables, user input, and all of the other programming concepts we've covered this fall using Kahoot. A bit of friendly competition is always a good time&mdash;everyone wins when we learn together!

                Students and mentors then worked together to establish a plan for success&mdash;specifically, a plan for success on our final projects! The final projects are completely open-ended and designed to showcase the Python Turtle Graphics programming skills students have picked up over the course of the fall&mdash;they provide a unique opportunity for students to tie together loops, functions, variables, and user input in a single program. Check out the example final projects below created by our mentors to get an idea of what students will be working on in Week 7 and presenting in Week 8!

                Next Saturday, we'll work through a brief content review and dedicate the majority of time to final projects. We're incredibly proud of all our students have accomplished this fall&mdash;we look forward to wrapping up Weeks 7 and 8 on a high note!

                            <b>What advice do you have for our students?</b><br>
                            Don't be afraid to try things that might not work&mdash;that's one of the best ways to learn!

                            I earned my PhD in Biology from the University of Washington (Seattle).

                            <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                            When I was in graduate school, I needed to write programs to model the evolution of microorganisms, then I found it was more fun to write code than clean petri dishes.

                            <b>What advice do you have for our students?</b><br>
                            Writing code is often frustrating and rewarding, often alternating between each every few minutes. Don't let the frustration stop you from enjoying the sense of accomplishment.

                            Never give up, do not be afraid to get out of your comfort zone, you should always believe in yourself and do not let anyone tell you what you cannot do. You should always remember that the sky is the limit.

            <h2>Week 5</h2>
            <h4>Very Able Variables</h4>
            <p>
                When things change, so do we! As humans, we adapt to our surroundings&mdash;consciously and unconsciously&mdash;to stay healthy and accomplish our goals. When it's hot, we sweat to cool off; when it's cold, we shiver to warm up; when we're faced with a challenge or a deadline, we narrow our focus to get things done. You might say we're <i>very able</i> to adapt to <i>variable</i> conditions&mdash;or, you might cringe at the horrible rhyme&mdash;in either case, you can't deny adaptation is crucial in our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps unsurprisingly, adaptation is crucial in code, too&mdash;without adaptation, any computer program will eventually run into a dead-end and crash. Thankfully, <i>variables</i> allow computer programs to adapt to changing circumstances&mdash;as their name suggests, they are <i>able</i> to <i>vary</i> when instructed to do so!
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we dive into a full recap of our meeting, we've got a few key announcements to share.
            </p>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
            <ul>
                <h4>1. Bonus Hour</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll be continuing to host a Bonus Hour every Thursday from 7-8p ET, and invite all Technovation participants to join us. At least two Technovation mentors will be available on Zoom during the bonus hour to resolve technical difficulties, dive deeper into the coding concepts we've learned, or to talk about computer science in general! Join us at the link below:
                </p>

                <p>
                    We'll be dedicating the majority of Week 6 to review the content we've covered in Weeks 1-5! We'll also spend a few minutes brainstorming ideas for final projects, which students will be working on in Week 7 and presenting at our final session in Week 8. If you missed a previous week's lesson or are feeling behind, hang in there and join us at Bonus Hour, then again this Saturday. We'll make sure you're caught up&mdash;no Technovator will be left behind!
                </p>
                <h4>3. Looking Ahead</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll see you again this Saturday, 11/6 at 10a ET for our sixth Technovation meeting of the fall! Zoom links will be the same as those used last week&mdash;we will send them out again on Saturday morning if you've lost them. Looking further ahead, we'll be meeting every Saturday through 11/20 at 10a ET.
                </p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Students kicked their brains into high gear from the get-go last Saturday, joining forces to solve a series of virtual escape rooms for this week's icebreaker! It was the perfect mental warm up for a morning of problem-solving, and a great way to encourage collaboration among students and mentors alike. If you're looking for something to bring your remote team together at work, look no further than the
                <a href="https://roomescapemaker.com/u/LudJr/HouseofDoors">Green House Virtual Escape Room</a> or the
                <a href="https://roomescapemaker.com/u/demo/dogescape">Dog Escape Virtual Escape Room</a>&mdash;but be warned that your student might solve it faster than you and your co-workers will!
            </p>
            <p>
                In this week's spotlight, we met Spot: an adorable robotic dog from Boston Dynamics! Spot's designed for urban search-and-rescue and other high-stakes, high-risk operations&mdash;but Spot's
                <a href="https://youtu.be/fn3KWM1kuAw">better known for being able to break a move.</a>
                Check out the video below to meet Spot and Spot's creators, and ask for your student's take on Spot: is Spot cool or creepy? Useful or pointless? What do they think Spot could be used for? Which part of Spot do they think would be hardest to program?

                Following our <i>Spot</i>-light, mentors introduced variables and how they are <i>able</i> to <i>vary</i> (we are full of puns today!). To show how variables allow code to adapt, mentors used variables to toggle Tracy's color between green and red, then to toggle the size of shapes drawn by Tracy between 100 and 50. Mentors then demonstrated how variables can be used to store <i>user input</i>&mdash;direct commands from a user at program runtime&mdash;and how this user input can be leveraged to make a piece of code more flexible.

                Following the lesson, students and mentors worked together through a festive Halloweekend-themed code-along, using loops, functions, variables, and user input to draw a virtual Jack-O-Lantern.

                            <b>What did you study?</b><br>
                            I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 1984!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>How did you become interested in computer science?</b><br>
                            The first time I ever learned anything about computing was in 1970.  A sophomore majoring in math at Kalamazoo College, I took a class on programming in Fortran. The next year I transferred to UMich, where math majors had to also have a 'cognate' (minor). Since I liked my programming class at K, I decided to make computing my cognate at UMich, learning Cobol and Algol. After graduation I had a chance to teach programming and math at Eastern Montana College. By that time I had flipped my allegiances. I still liked math, but I loved computing!

                            <b>What's something cool you've done with computer science?</b><br>
                            I taught coding and IT at a week-long residential summer camp for secondary school girls and their teachers in Rwanda for three summers. It was the opportunity of a lifetime to work with the Peace Corps in Rwanda on empowering young women in a third world country to pursue educations in technology!

                            <b>What are you hoping to do with computer science in the future?</b><br>
                            I think that code can play a role in uplifting all who want to make their world a better, and more equitable one. I hope to uplift a few, who will uplift more, who will uplift even more, ...

            <h4>Fun with Functions</h4>
            <p>
                We're surrounded by black boxes&mdash;tools that <i>just work</i> when used to complete a task. To most of us, cars are black boxes getting us from point A to point B; TVs are black boxes streaming video and audio into our living room; and phones are black boxes connecting us to our friends and family through social media, texts and calls. Black boxes make our world better&mdash;they make complex tasks easy and empower us to accomplish more with less time and energy. It's impossible to imagine modern life without them!
            </p>
            <p>
                In computer science, these black boxes take the form of <i>functions</i>&mdash;structures that hide the details of a complex task behind a simple statement. Functions <i>just work</i>, allowing us to think about other, higher-level concepts when writing code. This week, our coders learned how to write and call their own functions in Python&mdash;though you might just say they had fun with functions!
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we dive into a full recap of our meeting, we've got a few key announcements to share.

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                We opened this week's meeting with a classic, tried-and-true icebreaker: show-and-tell! Students courageously turned on their cameras and unmuted to share their favorite keepsakes&mdash;we saw trophies, art, games, souvenirs, flags, jerseys, and even met a few family pets! Ask your student what they shared!
            </p>
            <p>
                After show-and-tell, we welcomed Shannon Cawley to our meeting for a live spotlight. As Product Owner of Vehicle Software Updates at Ford, Shannon oversees the invisible&mdash;yet critical&mdash;processes which keep the computers in your Ford vehicles up-to-date. Shannon shared the details of her journey from a background in business to a career in tech, recounted the major technical contributions she's made at Ford, and shared the advice she'd give to her middle-school/high-school aged self. Shannon also fielded a number of great questions from our students&mdash;we were happy to see everyone so engaged!

                Following a brief review of the commands covered in Weeks 1-3&mdash;including color, pensize, begin_fill, end_fill, forward, backward, left, right, and circle&mdash;we dove into the fun world of functions. Functions allow us to simplify our code by serving as black boxes: they hide the complexities of a task behind a single statement and allow us to think about higher-level concepts when writing code. In a sense, functions teach Tracy the Turtle new tricks!

            </div>
            <p>
                More concretely, our students learned how to move the three lines of code required to draw a square&mdash;namely, (i) a line to loop four times, (ii) a line to move forward, and (iii) a line to turn left&mdash;from their main program into a custom-written function. Then, they replaced these three lines in their main program with a single line calling the custom-written function! The function became a black box that <i>just worked</i> and drew a square, allowing our students to think on higher-levels about creating more complex shapes composed of squares.
            </p>
            <p>
                After introducing functions, we solidified our understanding of their use by working through an example in which Tracy is tasked with drawing a set of colored shapes. By breaking the problem down and defining four separate functions to draw (i) a red diamond, (ii) a blue circle, (iii) a yellow semicircle, and (iv) a green pentagon, we hid the complexities of each shape in four separate black boxes and used those black boxes to produce our final drawing. Pretty nifty, eh?

            </div>
            <p>
                Next Saturday, we'll be introducing variables, structures which allow us to store information in our program during runtime. If you're feeling behind, however, don't fret&mdash;we'll also dedicate a significant chunk of time to reviewing loops, functions, and the other key concepts we've covered in Weeks 1-4. The best way to become a better programmer is to program more&mdash;and that's exactly what we plan to do in Week 5!

            <h4>Life in Color</h4>
            <p>
                What's your favorite color? Ours is <span style="color: green;">green</span>, of course! Perhaps you're a <span style="color: hotpink;">pink</span> person, or a <span style="color: purple;">purple</span> lover, or a fan of <span style="color: blue;">blue</span>; no matter your style, we can agree color makes life more exciting! This week, our students moved beyond the world of black and white to incorporate a whole rainbow of colors in their creations with code.

            <p>
                Students kicked off this week's meeting by creating and sharing a set of meme slides, sharing how their past week went through the use of "reaction" memes/gifs/images. We've included a few of our favorites below&mdash;we hope they bring you as many smiles and as much laughter as they brought us on Saturday!

                We followed up our icebreaker with a spotlight on artificial intelligence (AI), a popular and rapidly-growing area of computer science. We met Sophia, a humanoid robot created by Hanson Robotics whose claim to fame is being the first artificially-intelligent agent declared a citizen by Saudi Arabia! Whether you find Sophia's story creepy, inspiring, or somewhere in between, it's worth keeping an eye on the field of AI these days&mdash;it could revolutionize our world! Check out the video below to hear Sophia's story and learn more about how computer scientists contribute to the field of AI.

                After a brief recap of the programming concepts we've learned from previous weeks&mdash;including loops and basic commands like circle, forward, backward, left, and right&mdash;we moved on to add a splash of color to Tracy's once-black-and-white world. Students learned how to change the color of Tracy's pen with the color command, and learned how to fill in the interior of shapes using the begin_fill and end_fill commands. Students also learned how to adjust the pen size with which Tracy draws, and learned how to create more complex geometric shapes&mdash;such as triangles, diamonds, hexagons, and octogons&mdash;by tweaking the circle command.

                Despite the fast pace of Saturday's lesson, students and mentors slowed down towards the end of the meeting for an insightful reflection and discussion. We agreed it would benefit us all to dedicate this coming Saturday to review, as it's key we feel comfortable with loops, colors, and functions before moving further ahead in our curriculum! If your student felt challenged or behind at last week's meeting, let them know they'll have plenty of time to get caught up this week&mdash;no Technovator will be left behind!

            <h4>Again? Again!</h4>
            <p>
                Ever feel like you're running in circles? Our students and mentors did at Saturday's lesson, but don't worry&mdash;those circles were all part of the plan! Saturday's lesson introduced <i>loops</i>, a type of programming structure which tells a computer to repeat a set of instructions over, and over, and over, and over, ..., and over. As their name suggests, loops quite literally tell a computer to go in circles&mdash;we weren't spinning alone!

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Following a lively <a href="https://www.sli.do/">sli.do</a> icebreaker, students and mentors kicked off Saturday's lesson with an uplifting spotlight video from Khan Academy. Introducing the definition of a growth mindset and how it differs from a fixed mindset, the spotlight underscored the importance of bringing a growth mindset to Technovation every week. Learning to code is difficult, but the challenges we overcome as we navigate this learning process will ultimately make us stronger&mdash;we simply need to change the way we see failure! If we view it as an opportunity for improvement instead of a setback, we'll go far&mdash;if we're feeling down, we simply need to turn our frown upside-down and remember that all experiences are learning experiences!

            <p>
                Next, we jumped into our coding lesson for the week. We reviewed the coordinate plane in which our coding buddy Tracy the Turtle lives, then learned how to turn Tracy left and right. Combining these turns with the command we learned last week which instructs Tracy to move forward, we were able to write a program telling Tracy to draw a square!

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6" align="middle">
                        <img class="shadow-lg" src="assets/img/week2/square.png" width=90%>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                We followed this exercise with an introduction to loops, the programming structure we mentioned earlier which tells a computer to repeat a set of instructions over, and over, and over, and over, ..., and over. As students learned, loops bring two major advantages: they shorten our code, and make it easier to alter our code later on!
            </p>
            <div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">
                <div class="row">

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6" align="middle">
                        <img class="shadow-lg" src="assets/img/week2/loop2.png" width=90%>

                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="row">
                    <p><i>Going in circles isn't always a bad thing... that's exactly what loops are designed to do!</i></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Finally, we learned how to use the setposition and speed commands to fine-tune Tracy's behavior: setposition allows Tracy to jump around across our screen, while speed allows Tracy to move faster or slower! Ask your student to show you these commands in action&mdash;they're pretty cool!
            </p>
            <div align="middle" class="col-md-12" style="padding-top: 2em; padding-bottom: 2em">
                <div class="row">

                    </div>
                    <div class="col-md-6" align="middle">
                        <img class="shadow-lg" src="assets/img/week2/speed.png" width=90%>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="row">
                    <p><i>With the setposition command, Tracy's only a hop, skip, and a jump away from anywhere on the screen... and with the speed command, she can get there in a flash!</i></p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                As usual, students concluded Saturday's meeting with a brief reflection and discussion around what went well, what didn't go so well, and what excites them about the week ahead. We hope they're as excited as we are for Week 3!

            <h4>Three Times the Fun</h4>
            <p>
                Saturday marked the start of not one, not two, but <b>three</b> Technovation clubs&mdash;making for not one, not two, but three times the fun! Thanks to generous support from <a href="https://www.ford.com/">Ford Motor Company</a> and continued funding from the <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/">Michigan State University College of Engineering</a>, we've expanded the scope of Technovation beyond the Greater Lansing area this fall to engage students all across the great state of Michigan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before we dive into a full recap of our first meeting, we've got a few announcements to share!
            </p>

            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Announcements</h4>
            <ul>
                <h4>1. Consent Forms</h4>
                <p>
                    We're still missing parental consent forms for half of our students! If you have not yet submitted a <a href="https://forms.gle/c77hK9qUu29j76nW6">Fall 2021 Technovation Consent Form</a> for each of your students registered for Technovation, please do so as soon as possible. This is required by MSU Youth Program Policy, and should take no more than 5 minutes to complete.
                </p>
                <h4>2. Remind</h4>
                <p>
                    If you haven't already, subscribe to our Remind service to receive instant updates about the Fall 2021 session of Technovation! Text <b>@f21tech</b> to <b>81010</b> or follow <a href="https://www.remind.com/join/f21tech">this link</a> to subscribe. We'll continue to send weekly updates via email, but we know how full inboxes can become!
                </p>
                <h4>3. Participant Pre-Survey</h4>
                <p>
                    Students were encouraged to fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/UHAgEVymxeS2HRN78">Fall 2021 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> at Saturday's meeting, but not everyone submitted their responses. If your student has not yet completed the pre-survey, please have them do so before this Saturday's meeting.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Bonus Hour</h4>
                <p>
                    Back by popular demand, we'll be hosting a Technovation "bonus hour" every Thursday from 7-8p ET (beginning this Thursday, 10/7) open to all Technovation participants. At least two Technovation mentors will be available on Zoom during the bonus hour to resolve technical difficulties, dive deeper into the coding concepts we've learned, or to talk about computer science in general! Join us at the link below:
                </p>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <h4>5. Looking Ahead</h4>
                <p>
                    We'll see you again this Saturday, 10/9 at 10a ET for our second Technovation meeting of the fall! Zoom links will be the same as those used last week&mdash;we will send them out again on Saturday morning if you've lost them. Looking further ahead, we'll be meeting every Saturday through 11/20 at 10a ET.
                </p>
                <h4>6. Geographic Cohorts</h4>
                <p>
                    As we mentioned above, we're running three sessions of Technovation this fall&mdash;split by geographic region&mdash;in order to broaden our reach and serve students all across the state of Michigan. Content covered in each geographic cohort will be equivalent&mdash;cohorts are just for organization, and encourage student-mentor interaction by decreasing group sizes. If you're unsure of which cohort your student is in, check the subject line of the welcome email sent last week!
                </p>
                <h4>7. Questions?</h4>
                <p>
                    As always, please reach out with any questions / concerns / ideas / feedback to <a href="mailto:info@spartangwc.org">info@spartangwc.org</a>.
                </p>
            </ul>

            <h4 class="text-center">Meeting Recap</h4>
            <p>
                Our students wasted no time getting started, jumping fearlessly into introductions and icebreakers! Following a brief overview of Technovation and the plan for each weekly meeting this fall, students in each cohort collaborated to draft their very own club contract, laying out their shared expectations and goals towards which to strive this fall. Check out the contracts below&mdash;we're impressed with what our students came up with!
            </p>

                After our inspiring spotlight, students filled the <a href="https://forms.gle/UHAgEVymxeS2HRN78">Fall 2021 Technovation Participant Pre-Survey</a> to share their interests and prior experience with us&mdash;if your student did not submit this survey, please encourage them to do so. Students then created CodeHS accounts and began to work through the first few exercises in the <a href="https://codehs.com/course/introtracy/overview">Intro to Python with Tracy</a> course we'll be completing together in Technovation this fall. See the video below for a brief introduction to Tracy and an overview of the sort of programming our students will be learning!

            <p>
                Students concluded the session with a reflection and discussion around what went well, what didn't go so well, and what excites them about the week ahead&mdash;and just like that, our two hours were up! Time flies when we're having fun&mdash;we're already looking forward to next Saturday.
            </p>


            <!------------------------------------------>

            <h4 class="text-center">Mentor Spotlight</h4>
            <p>
                This fall, we'll be including a new section in our weekly newsletter: the Mentor/Advisor Spotlight! Technovation is led, organized, and run by MSU students under the guidance of faculty advisors from MSU and Ford, and we thought it would be fun to introduce a few of our team members each week.
            </p>
            <p>
                To kick off our spotlight series, we'd like to introduce the Fall 2021 Lead Mentors!

                <a href="https://www.ford.com/">Ford Motor
                Company</a> and
                continued funding from <a href="https://www.egr.msu.edu/">Michigan
                State University College of Engineering</a> will allow Technovation to serve
                three locations this fall&mdash;Lansing, Detroit, and
                All Michigan!
            </p>
            <p>
                Founded in 2018, Technovation is an MSU student-led coding club introducing
                6-12th grade students in Michigan to the wide world of computer science.
                Combining games and mini-projects with guest speakers and team-building activities,
                Technovation is more than just another extracurricular—it's a community.
                We believe coding should be <i>fun</i>, and we aim to make it so!
            </p>
            <p>

                To protect students and faculty in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Technovation has been suspended indefinitely and will
                be succeeded by SPARCC (SPARtan Coding Club), a fully-remote coding club slated to
                launch in Spring 2021.
            </p>
            <p>
                Run by students for students, current MSU students will guide current 6-12th grade students
                through an exciting, engaging and empowering learning experience. Building upon the foundation established by
                Technovation and Spartan Girls Who Code, SPARCC is reimagining what's possible in our post-pandemic world and raising the bar of virtual education.
