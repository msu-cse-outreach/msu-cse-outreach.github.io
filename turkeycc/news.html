									That's all for the Summer MSUxIzmirSev, Students—it's been a pleasure working with each and every one of you, and we hope you've had as much fun as we have. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for bearing with us through the first-ever virtual MSUxIzmirSev Coding Club—your enthusiasm, energy, and smiles are the reason we love to do what we do. We've found joy in the community that MSUxIzmirSev has brought during these trying times, and with solace in the normalcy it has restored. Before we know it, we'll be back in person—but in the meantime, we're glad we were able to make the most of the circumstances.
