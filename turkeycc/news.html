								Computer Science is challenging and exciting, learning to code is so important to teach students how to communicate and think logically. Coding helps students understand the world around them better. Coding fosters creativity and allows students to apply their creative thinking skills. Joining the MSU x Izmir Sev Coding Club is a great way to learn these skills in a challenging, engaging, and positive environment. The challenges you overcome, the views you enjoy, and the friends you make are what it's all about.
